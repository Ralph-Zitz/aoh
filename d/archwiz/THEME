What is the theme of the archwiz domain?
Well, this domain doesn't have a special theme. It simply is the center
of the world. Yes, the center. Or better: The most important part of it.

This domain contains Nightfall City, the capital of this world and the 
tower in which you currently are in. (files in +archwiz/common/room/city/)

The ancient cathedral of NF City is also meant as birthplace for those
races, who haven't got their own yet.
 
The white house north of the city church can be entered. Below some house
indoor rooms is a large dungeon with a labyrinth and a miniquest around
a functioning 'flood control dam' which can be operated by players.

The 'find captain Kirk' quest is located here.
