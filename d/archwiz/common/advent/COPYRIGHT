Adventure is Freeware.
It may be used, played, changed, adored and mutilated as one likes as long
as no unrightful ownership is claimed, all due credits are given, all
documentation kept, and no monetary gain achieved ... well, you get my drift.

And Lars says: If you port Adventure to a different LPMud, give me notice.
  I'd like to see how your port looks like.
