Adventure - by Willie Crowther and Don Woods, 1977
--------------------------------------------------
Implemented using the ports of David M. Baggett (TADS)
and Graham Nelson (Inform).

This area of the Archwiz domain is a re-implementation of 'Advent'.
Goal is to collect all the treasures in the Cave and deposit it
at the 'dump site', solving several riddles on the way. For each treasure
dumped, the player is rewarded with XP, but just once per treasure.
Optionally, the completion of the task (i.e. finding and dumping all
treasures) can be awarded as a (mini)quest.

History
  Adventure was the first adventure game ever written, based on a FORTRAN
  simulation of the Mammoth and Flint Ridge cave system by Willie Crowther.
  Crowther was one of its exploreres: some of the game's locations are real,
  Bedquilt for instance. (And 'Y2' is a reverence to the cave-map notation for
  'alternative entrace to caves'.)

  Adventure (sometimes called 'Colossal Cave', another real place) was an
  extension largely by Don Woods, a colleague of Crowther's at a Massachusetts
  computing firm. Inspired by a variant of the role-playing game 'Dungeons
  and Dragons', they added puzzles and magic to the caves.

  The game was spread from machine to machine, and (among others) DECUS,
  the Digital users group, issued tapes of it. Ever since, the games has
  been modified, ported, improved, extended and generally corrupted.
  The original is hard to find. Most of the extras tacked on are clearly
  inferior, and lose the spirit of the (certainly imperfect, but atmospheric
  and well-designed) original.

  And, even by modern standards, it is still a good game!

  This is a copy at fourth hand. It is an adaption of Graham Nelson's version
  from 1994 for Inform, which was based on David M. Baggets excellent 1993
  version for Adventions, written in TADS, which in turn derived from
  Donald Ekman's PC port of the original FORTRAN source code.
  The Nightfall version is based on both David's and Graham's code.


I tried to stay close to the original, but had to modify it to fit it into
Nightfall more cleanly (e.g. to make it multi-user capable).
Major changes been done are:
 - The outside area with the well-house and the forest is a separate part
   of the game. Nothing happens here, it's just to have this part of
   Advent as well. It is not integrated into the gameplay itself as it
   doesn't fit to the old C.A.R.T. tunnels. As it's not easy to find,
   the player will get an explorer point for reaching it.
 - The player can switch between the original few details, and the
   extended Nightfall details. For this, a new command 'advent' (alias
   'adventure') has been added. This way, players can both enjoy the original
   charm of the game and/or use the modern, more elaborate detailing.
 - The endgame was completely off-athmospheric for Nightfall and also
   illogical, so it was abandoned. As a side effect, the cave doesn't
   close.
 - The treasures are 'highlighted' by an exclamation mark in their short
   description, so the player gets a clue to dump instead of selling them.
   Also, merely taking them doesn't give XP, just dropping them at the
   dump site.
 - Dropping all the treasures at the dump site counts as completion of
   Advent and is logged in l/SPELUNKERS.
 - Once the player solved the cave, the entrace gate becomes immaterial
   for him.
 - Right after the grate, a new passages forks off into the 'Hall Of Fame'.
   There the players can read the l/SPELUNKERS file and are also informed
   about the 'adventure' command'.
 - The nature of LPMud with it's recreation of items makes the 'fee fie
   foe foo' puzzle around the troll worthless. A different puzzle has
   been implemented (see below).
 - The vending machine in the Different Maze was deactivated: batteries
   don't fit into Nightfall, and the Rare Coins are recreated every
   reset.
 - There are some more possibilities for players to score.
 - The useless hint on the oyster was left out.

At some points, the player has to pass by (initially) unfriendly NPCs.
Instead of hardening the NPC against all (Guild) magic and combat, I reward
quite a lot of XP the first time the correct puzzle solution is performed
(more than killing the NPC would give). Furthermore, the player can
then pass the NPCs later again without further trouble.

The two mazes in Advent are created using virtual rooms which are created
on need by a master object.
  The 'Alike Maze' uses the master r/alikemaze and reserves the namespace
r/amaze000 to r/amaze199 for its rooms (used are r/amaze001..r/amaze014
and r/amaze101..r/amaze109). The maze connects the West End of Hall of Mists
with the Pirate's Dead End (where the Treasure Chest stands). It provides
an exit to the Bird Chamber near the Pirates' Dead End. A second exit,
somewhat randomized, is from Top of Stalactite.
The quickest way through the maze is: 
        Alike Maze 1      -(e)-  Alike Maze 2  -(s)- Alike Maze 3 
  -(n)- Pirate's Dead End -(se)- Alike Maze 13 -(n)- At Brink Of Pit
  -(d)- Bird Chamber
  The 'Different Maze' uses the master r/diffmaze and reserves the namespace
r/dmaze00 to r/dmaze99 for its rooms (used are r/dmaze01..r/dmaze11).
The maze houses the vending machine (which was once used to give out
fresh batteries). It is not very useful nowadays and of very annoying
layout. One of the quickest ways through the maze is:
        Diff. Maze 1    -(s)- Diff. Maze 3  -(e)- Diff. Maze 2
  -(s)- Vending Machine -(n)- Diff. Maze 2 -(sw)- Diff. Maze 3
  -(w)- Diff. Maze 1    -(d)- West of Long Hall
The layout of the maze can be visualised as a rugby ball: dmaze01 and
dmaze02 lie at the both ends, the other rooms form a ring around the mid
of the ball. Each 'ring room' is connected with dmaze01 and dmaze02, the
other exits lead to other ring rooms.

The only justification for the mazes are that these are the first mazes
at all in interactive fiction. Nowadays mazes should be avoided, or at
least be solvable by some other method than brute-force-mapping.


The most noteworthy parts of Adventure are these:
  - Moving in the dark has a 25% chance of hurting the player (5 HP).
  - The old pregame outside the cave is accessible for sightseeing from
     the Treasure Dump Site by touching the floor.
     The player is also rewarded with an Explorer Point.
  - The entrance to the cave is barred by a grate. The keys for the grate
     are at the Subterranean Well.
  - The Black Rod in the Debris Room (actually an old fairy staff) is to
     create the crystal bridge over the fissure by waving it there.
     However, as long as the player has the rod, she won't be able to catch
     the little bird.
  - The little bird (Bird Chamber) can either be taken or being caught with 
     the wicker cage (Cobble Crawl).
     When the bird is freed in the Hall of the Mt. King, it will drive the
     snake away. Freeing it at the Dragon won't be of much use :-)
  - The Snake in the Hall of the Mt. King is to be driven away by the little
     bird. This works only if the bird newly enters the room - if it was
     already there when the Snake arrives (e.g. due to a reset), the Snake
     'knows' the bird and won't be afraid of it.
     When the Snake has been scared away once, the player may freely pass,
     even if later the Snake reappears.
  - By use of the commands 'xyzzy' or 'plugh' the player may teleport
     between the treasure dump site and the Debris Room (r/debrisroom)
     resp. Y2. The commands can be said or commanded.
  - The Gold Nugget cannnot be carried out of the cave, attempting to do so
     the player will hurt herself. It must be transported out using the
     Y2 teleport.
  - The Narrow Passage above the Twopit Room can be reached by watering
     the beanstalk in the West Pit. But beware: too much water, and the
     bean stalk crumbles.
  - The oil in the West Pit can be used to oil the hinges of the door
     blocking the entrance to the Cavern with Waterfall.
     Using water for the hinges rusts them again :-)
  - The dragon guarding the Persian Rug in Secret Canyon can be 'bluffed'
     away: after the command 'kill dragon', the game asks if the player
     wants to kill the dragon with her bare hands. If the players answers
     'yes' (or commands it), the dragon will die. If she answers 'no',
     nothing happens. If she commands 'kill dragon' again, the normal
     kill-routine will happen.
  - Dropping the Ming Vase will cause to break it (also filling water into
     it). To prevent this, let a cushion or pillow lie in the room first.
     A Velvet Pillow can be found in r/softroom.
  - Access to the Plover Room with the Emerald is limited to players with
     at max one item in their pack (not counting autoloaders).
  - The glistening Pearl is in the clam in the Shell Room. The shell can
     be opened just with the Jeweled Trident (Cavern with Waterfall).
     The pearl will fall out of the clam and roll into the Cul-de-Sac.
  - Contrary to the sign, it is not possible to pay the bridge toll, as the
     troll will always claim that it's not enough. The solution is to give
     him the nest of golden eggs (Giant Room) and then to recite the magic
     formula 'fee fie foe foo'. This causes the nest to heat up, driving
     the troll away in pain.
  - The Golden Chain (Barren Room) must be unlocked with the set of keys
     found at the Subterranean Well (the same which opened the grate).
     However, unless the player didn't feed the bear (preferably with the
     food also found at the Well), she won't get near enough the chain
     to do anything with it.
  - Witt's End can be exited in any direction but 'west'. However, there
     is a 80% chance (original: 95%) that the player will bounce back
     into Witt's End.
  - The Pirate will steal things from the player (3% chance on every player
     move) and store it in Pirate's Dead End. It will be turned off (removed)
     whenever a player enters the Dead End and spots the Treasure Chest.
     The dwarf scares the pirate away.
  - The Dwarfs cease to attack the player after she killed five of them
     during the current session. Alternatively, leading the dwarf into
     the Mirror Canyon gets rid of him as well.
     If nothing happens, there is a 3% chance per heartbeat that the dwarf
     wanders away out of boredom.

These rewards are given to the player (each just once):
  - Finding the old pregame: 1 Explorer Point, 50 XP.
  - Reaching the Hall of Mists the first time: 3500 XP.
  - Scaring away the Snake (Hall of Mt King): 30000 XP (killing it: 25000 XP).
      In the original, this was not scored, but I had to compensate for

      (killing it: 30000 XP).
      In the original, this was not scored, but I had to compensate for
      those who simply kill the dragon.

  - Rare Spices (Chamber of Boulders): 1600 XP.
  - Feeding the Cave Bear (Barren Room): 25000 XP (killing it: 20000 XP).
      In the original, this was not scored, but I had to compensate for
      those who simply kill the dragon.
  - Golden Chain (Barren Room): 1600 XP.
  - Finding the Vending Machine: 1000 XP.
  - Dropping all treasures in the Treasure Dump:

Some Technical Notes...

  Persistant Data
    Advent needs several persistant data to be saved with the player
    (e.g. what treasures have been found, which magic words have been 
    activated, ...).
    As these are all binary flags, the data is collected in a bitflag string
    and stored as the attribute "AdventData" in the player. This makes a special
    autoloading object unnecessary. 
    The flags are diverted into two groups: the 'treasure found' flags,
    ranging from 0..F_NUM_TREASURES, and flags to store data about the players
    proceeding, ranging from 100 upward.
    When the player completes Advent, the state flag F_SOLVED is set, which
    causes every flag below F_NUM_TREASURES to be read as 'set', even if it
    isn't (this prevents the player from solving Advent again).
    The flags are handled via i/advlib (this also allows later changes in the
    data structure should they become necessary), their definitions are
    in advent.h.

  Standard Caveroom (i/stdroom.c)
    The standard caveroom is an extension of the normal /std/room, adding
    the Advent specialities:
     - default descriptions for Noise and Smell
     - the distinction between the sparse original and the elaborate new
       detailing
     - players moving in the dark have a 25% chance of being hurt (2 HP).
     - the special commands are implemented: 'advent[ure]', 'xyzzy', 'plugh'
       and the word sequence 'fee fie foe foo'.
     - the handling of the pirate
     - the activation of the dwarf.
     
    The 'original' Details are stored as normal details, but are
    additionally listed in the P_ORIGLIST property. This is a list of
    strings of the form '<type>:<detailid>', with <type> being 'look',
    'smell', 'noise' and 'read', depending on the type of the detail.
    For easier handling not only {Add,Remove}OrigTag(), but also
    {Add,Remove}Orig{Detail,Smell,Noise,ReadMsg}() exist.
    The distinction is evaluated in the overloaded Get-() functions.
    Setting the property P_NOORIG to non-zero switches back to the usual
    detail handling.
