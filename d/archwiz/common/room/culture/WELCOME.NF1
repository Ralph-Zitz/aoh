Welcome to NIGHTFALL (LPmud 3.1.2/mudlib 2.4.5) at Tuebingen/Germany!

NIGHTFALL is sort of a "Virtual Reality". It simulates interactions between
various "objects" as persons, rooms and items using a C-like programming
language to define these "objects". So called "wizards" can interactively
expand the "VR" by writing new programs. To join, you have to select a name
for your character and assign a password to it.

Use the "guest" name if you just want to look around a bit.
