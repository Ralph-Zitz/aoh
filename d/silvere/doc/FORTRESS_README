Fortress README - by Isorn

I placed the fortress somewhere in middle of large fields, to the north there are
only fields, to the east there are snowy peaks far in the distance, to the west
there are more fields with rolling hills and a forest edge crowning those hills,
to the south there will be a river beyond the fields.

File names -

nobat1 to nobat9 are the north battlements rooms
eabat1 to eabat8 are the east battlements rooms
webat1 to webat8 are the west battlements rooms
sobat1 to sobat6 are the south battlements rooms (not done at the moment)

The towers have 3 levels, first two levels have 4 rooms each while the third one
has only one room. The rooms are named with the reference to which tower it is
and two numbers, first one is the level and the second one being the position:
1 means northwest, 2 northeast, 3 southwest and 4 southeast
ie:
nwto21 means the nortnwest room at the second level of the northwestern tower

nwto11 to nwto34 are the northwestern tower romms (not finished yet)
neto11 to neto33 are the northeastern tower rooms (not finished yet)
swto11 to swto32 are the southwestern tower rooms (not finished yet)
seto11 to seto31 are the southeastern tower rooms (not finished yet)

There are more file names to be added, they will be added as i finish them

Location changes and descriptions changes -

Should the location of the fortress change there should be some changes to be
done in room descs and details. The changes would be done in the rooms facing
the change of surroundings.
