The Battle Of Sykorath
======================
 
On the surrounding hills the chieftains from either side sat on
their war horses, watching their carefully thought out battle
plans disintegrate. The creek and small streams flowed red with 
blood. Dead and wounded from either side lay sprawled over the rolling 
hills. War horses and beasts of battle lay screaming and dying 
in the bloody field. Broken catapults, weapons and staffs littered 
the battle ground. 
 
The remaining combatants used every imaginable magic and material
weapon they could find as the battle overflowed through the city
gates. The horrified citizens screamed as they saw their loved ones 
dying and their homes and shops set afire. The fighting advanced 
into the inner city until it reached the Temple of Xarxos. The battle 
became fiercer, until only a handful of soldiers from either side 
remained.  
 
It was in the Temple of Xarxos the last two warring chieftains
came face to face. The remains of their armies stood by in
silence and watched the chieftains do battle. They slowly circled 
each other on the blood soaked temple stones. 
 
"[Name here], God Of Light is the one true God!" screamed [name   
 here] the Chieftain Of Light.
 
"Nay! [Name here] The Great Dark God wins against all!" yelled 
 [name here] Chieftain of The Dark Forces.
 
They struck each other blow for bloody blow splattering blood and
gore over the horrified watchers. Their swords and battle axes 
broke time and time again from the mighty blows. They cast deadly 
spell against deadly spell. Again and again they hit each other severing 
limbs and doing mortal damage, until they both fell dead to the ground. 
 
Slowly, the soldiers and towns people turned away from the blood soaked
temple. The survivors of the armies of Dark and Light walked
away side by side. Together in peace they would begin to rebuild
what remained of their land. [Dark God] and [Light God] waited.
