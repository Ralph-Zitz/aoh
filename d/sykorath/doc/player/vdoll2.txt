The Origin Of The Voodoo Doll
=============================
 
The voodoo doll can trace its roots to the tribes of the West
African Rain Forest. Dolls played an important role in their
lives. Dolls were more than childrens toys to the tribe. Dolls
were also teaching devices.   
 
The people of the Rain Forest were easy prey for the European
slave traders. The slavers captured them and sold the tribesmen
into slavery in the Americas. 
 
Slavery was particularly brutal on the island of Haiti. In
dispair the Haitian slaves found a common bond in their faith.
Their different beliefs and rituals eventually formed into one
religion called Voodoo. Afraid of this religious bond the slave
owners outlawed the slave religion. The slaves continued to
practice their religious rite and rituals in secret.    
 
In one ritual the slaves constructed dolls of straw. They molded
them into human shapes with cloth and string. They attached
finger nail clippings or hair from their owners to the dolls. The
slaves tortured the human like dolls with needles believing their
owners would feel the pain.
