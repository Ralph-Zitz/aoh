/*
 * example 2 for drink-able vitems
 * Magictcs - 15 march 98
 *
 * demonstrate how to use the new property for vitems to allow to drink them
 * we want to limit the drinks!
 */

/*
  How to use it:
  simplest version:

  AddVItem( ([
    P_IDS:  ({"id1","id2",...}),
    P_ADS:  ({"ad1","ad2",...}),
    P_LONG: "long description of vitem...",
    P_DRINK: ([ drink-mapping ]) ,
    P_AMOUNT: amount,
  ]) );

  or

  AddVItem( ([
    P_IDS:  ({"id1","id2",...}),
    P_ADS:  ({"ad1","ad2",...}),
    P_LONG: "long description of vitem...",
    P_DRINK: #'closure_to_clone_me_a_drink_to_drink ,
    P_AMOUNT: amount,
  ]) );

  NOTE: as long as our drinks don't support properties - only the second
        version is correct!!!! ---> see examples

  it is possible to cascade the vitems (like the water in our example!):
  drink water from well
  vitem#1 = well
  vitem#2 = water (cascaded to well)
