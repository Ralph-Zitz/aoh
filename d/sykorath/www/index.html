We started with th implementation of two towns - one more good aligned 
and one more the chaotic, evil ones.
The towns named 'Silvere' and 'Sykorath'.
<p>
Sykorath will become the more chaotic ones of these both towns.
<p>
The towns will have connections to each other and will completely 
replace the old archwiz-domain inherited from nightfall.
