NAME
        decltype

SYNTAX
        decltype(<expr>)

DESCRIPTION
        The expression will compiled just to determine the resulting type.
        The expression itself will not be executed. The result of this
        operator is the lpctype value representing the expression result.

NOTE
        The result of this operator depends on a lot of factors, for example
        if any type information is preserved for any inherited programs that
        are referenced in the expression. But it also depends on the type
        inference capabilities of the LPC compiler. So future versions of
        LDMud might have different results on the same expression.


EXAMPLES
        int var;
        decltype(var)   /* result: [int] */

        string fun();
        decltype(fun()) /* result: [string], fun() will not be called. */

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.6.7.
