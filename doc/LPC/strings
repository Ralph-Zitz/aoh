CONCEPT
    strings
    
DESCRIPTION

    Strings in lpc are true strings, not arrays of characters
    as in C (and not pointers to strings). 
    
    Strings are mutable -- that is, the contents of a string can be
    modified as needed. 
    
    Strings are automatically concatenated by the gamedriver at runtime,
    so the + operator is no longer strictly necessary to combine two 
    strings. For example:
    
        write("This is string one. "
              "This is string two.");
              
    will print out:  
    
        This is string one. This is string two.
        
    LPC does not have a 'char' datatype. It is possible, though, to
    count and access individual characters by using indexing (array
    notation). For example, 
    
        string s;
        s = "abcdefg";
        return s[2];    // returns 'c'
        
    Note that although 'c' (in single quotes) is returned, this is
    not a char! The gamedriver treats such values as integers containing
    the ascii value of the character.
    
    The gamedriver performs run-time bounds checking on strings.
    
    String indexes begin counting with 0, like arrays.
    
    Most string output automatically wraps to line length in OSB.
