Each adventurer has an alignment. It's something like 'good', 'neutral',
'holy' ...

This alignment depends on the race of the player. Each race has an
relative zero point for it's alignment. E.g. humans 0, elves 300 and
orcs -200. If an human meets an elf with align 300, the elf looks holy.
But the elf by himself looks only neutral. If an orc meets an demon
with align -250, the demon looks 'nice' to the orc. Also the elf with
align 300 will look 'very evil' or 'satanic' to the orc.

Internal handling:

There is one central alignment variable in each player. At the start
the value is set to the realtive zero point of the race. When a player
attacks or kills something the align is modified.

Here are some suggestions for functions:

void set_absolute_align(int value) 
	Sets the absolute alignment value
	(Mostly used by creation of player)

int query_absolute_align()
	Returns the absolute alignment value.

int ModifyAlign(int difference)
	Changes the alignment value. Called from combat system and
	several wizard objects.

varargs int QueryAlign(object opposite)
	Returns the relative alignment value. The absolute align is set into
        relation with the zero point of the race alignment if no argument
	is given.
	When an opposite is given, the zero point of the race of the opposite
	is the base.

string GiveAlignString(int align-value)
	Converts the align value into a string (good, neutral, ...).
