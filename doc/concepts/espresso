CONCEPT
        Expresso

DESCRIPTION
        There's a wide assortment of espresso available,
        including lattes, mochas, flavored lattes, iced
        lattes, and iced mochas.
        You can also order a straight shot of espresso but
        it just sorta tastes like burnt coffee, and I don't
        suggest you try it.
        A good thing for beginners to try is a flavored 
        latte, such as vanilla.  Its sweet and tasty.
        
        As you get more experienced with espresso, you can
        move on to other types of mixes, shakes, and
        some rather strangely named ones.

        Coffee is still a fine choice for many.  I like to
        think of espresso as a nice alternative on
        certain days.
