DESCRIPTION
	Magic is everything that is related to spells, scrolls, potions
	and all other magic that may upset the normal activity in Night-
	fall. Magic tends to allow all sorts of activity that make 
	securing measures in castles useless or quests trivial. Known
	examples are teleport spells, heal spells (if too good), kill 
	spells, mote spells (yes!, imagine a quest, where the wizard 
	uses catch_talk in a npc to get a string like "Player gives
	sword to Leo" and the Player uses emote to simulate it). To see 
	the problems, imagine how magic would upset our real world.

	So, it is a very difficult task to decide which magic doesn't do
	too much harm to the balance of the game. On the other hand, 
	magic makes life more exciting.

	Up to now we are checking all magic things. Later you will be 
	able to find more information here.
	
	Teleport: If you want to create teleporting items or spells
		  please look first at the teleport manpage and the 
		  example dungeons. 

	Spells:   For writing objects that allow to cast spells or
        Scrolls:  for writing scrolls refer to the spell and scroll
                  manpages.

	Items:	  MageNPC, objects for increrasing Attributes and
                  Defences and Resistances can be found in 
                  the MAGIC_OBJ_DIR. 
                  More will come soon.

SOURCES
	The magic stuff is coded in many different files.
	Example files can be found in /d/archwiz/common/magic/rooms:
		t1 - t4    -- Example rooms for teleporting

FURTHER INFORMATION
        Some additional documentation on magic objects can be found
        in /d/woodland/common/doc/magic and /p/magic/doc!
        There is also some description available about magic items,
        like mage npcs, magic resistance and so on.
