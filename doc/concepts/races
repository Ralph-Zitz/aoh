DESCRIPTION
	This document describes the basics of the race implementation
	in this mud.

	Every races is described by a set of attributes and some basic
	physical abilities. These include at the moment:
	
	- attributes  : the intrinsic attributes of a race
	- basic alignment: the alignment a creature of the race has at
	                   its birth.
	- max. food    : the max amount of food it can eat.
	- max. drink   : the max amount of liquid it can drink.
	- max. alcohol : the max level of intoxication it can stand.
	- hands        : the number of hands and their weapon-class.
	- defences     : the intrinsic defences against attacks.
	- home         : the default entry-point for this race.
	- long         : a long description.
	- skills       : a set of skills the race's livings has from
                         birth on.

	The intrinsic attributes include the basic stats, the normal
	attributes, the abilities and the spells.
	Actually defined are:
	
	Stats:
	- A_STR     strength     : the ability to carry something.
	- A_INT     intelligence : the ability to understand and cast magic.
	- A_DEX     dexterity    : the ability to handle a weapon.
	- A_CON     constitution : the ability to survive injuries.
	- A_IVISION infravision  : the minimal lightlevel needed to see.
	- A_UVISION ultravision  : the maximal lightlevel allowed to see.
	
	Attributes:
	Abilities:
	Spells:

 	The attributes STRength, INTelligence, CONstitution and
 	DEXterity are for humans defined as being equal to the generic level
 	of the beings. Thus other races are described just by
 	_offsets_ to the default human setting.

	Every change of these stats must be balanced afterwards
	against the living's race.
	To allow for special things (e.g. extra int points for Mage's
	Guild) each player is allowed have boni on attributes and
	abilities.

	The standard attributes/abilities are defined in
	/sys/attributes.h.

	The races are specified in an /obj/racemaster, so that every
	archwizard may add a new race. Every race depending object has
	to query this racemaster for information.
