DESCRIPTION
Spells are the usual way to handle magic. Players
usually find scrolls of magic spells which then can be cast to
invoke the magic or can be  memorized by members of a magic guild.
These memorized spells will then always be known to this player
and will be learned better by practising them.

To easily write spells you should inherit "/obj/scroll" or the
more basic module "/obj/caster" and use their functions.
Refer to 'scroll(O)' and 'caster(O)' for details.

To use magic spells with NPCs, refer to "/obj/spellmonster" which
provides the necessary functions to handle magic NPCs.

To learn about the protection against magic spells refer to
'resistance(C)'.

Here are some general guidelines to keep the power of
magic balanced. The Homeguild of the spells as well as
the HP or SP used are only rough guidelines. A real amount
of damage or healing done will usually depend on a 
randomized function or the player stats, too.
