DESCRIPTION
        This document explains restrictions dealing with the weapon class 
        (WC) of weapons in OSB.

        - Max weapon class for all weapons in OSB is 20, and this is definitely
        nothing new, and is not static either. It is, however, only special
        weapons that are allowed above 16. Max weapon class for one-handed
        weapons is 12.

        - weapons above the maximum weapon types of 12/16 have to be
        checked with the department of defence before making them available
        to players. Those weapons should be very hard to get and have
        serious drawbacks in other areas like a low ResetQuality or a low
        WPperQP.
 
        - There are several different weapon types (with their respective
        damage types) to choose from:

                WT_SWORD    (DT_SLASH)
                WT_AXE      (DT_SLASH)
                WT_WHIP     (DT_SLASH)

                WT_KNIFE    (DT_PIERCE)
                WT_SPEAR    (DT_PIERCE)
                WT_INFANTRY (DT_PIERCE)

                WT_STAFF    (DT_BLUDGEON)
                WT_CLUB     (DT_BLUDGEON)
                WT_CHAIN    (DT_BLUDGEON)

        Please do not set the damage type manually. It is automatically
        set when setting the weapon type. If you feel the need for a
        specific combination of WC, damage type and weapon type that
        is not met here, contact the archwizards of defence, it might
        be that including a new weapon type is a better solution than
        just changing the damage type.

        - Each weapon should be initialized by a call to SetStandard
        with weapon type, WC and size as parameters. This call may
        be done in the form of SetStandard(type,wc,size) or
        Set(P_STANDARD,({type,wc,size})), thus allowing for
        calling SetStandard in AddItem, too.

        - Whenever a weapon is made available to players, mail should be
        sent to the archwizards of defence. Alternately, weapons can
        also be registered at the registration machine in the defence
        store (east of the defence department's office) with a line
        of text describing their use etc.

        - Weight and Value of the weapon should stay somewhere along
        the lines set by SetStandard. Please don't make powerful
        weapons too light or weapons sold in shops too cheap.

        - weapons that in any way modify the weaponclass or damage done
        by overloading QueryDamage/CalcDamage, setting of HitObjects,
        allowing to set a new weaponclass at runtime or similar effects
        have to follow all rules, too. Furthermore, they have to take 
        care not to offend the guildrules for maximum WC (and damage).
