SYNOPSIS
  www

DESCRIPTION
  Every wizard can add custom text to their www page. To do it, though,
  you do need to know how to mark up HTML. 

  To add text to your HTML pages, do this:

    1. Make a subdirectory in your players dir called 'www'.

    2. Make a file in your www directory called 'index.html'.

    3. DON'T use these tags in your index file: <HTML>, <HEAD> or
       <BODY> (as well as the off-tags of these). They are added
       automagically by the www daemon. This way we can keep our
       web pages consistant. Don't add the OSB banner gif either;
       this is also added automatically.

    4. Add whatever you want to your page. The top will always look 
       like this:


         Information on Tune:

         Tune goes Eeeew, fooey Bah!

          o Race: elf Guild: bard Gender: female
          o Age: 10:46:38 Wizard 


       Your text will get added underneath this. If you don't know
       how to mark up HTML, ask me (Tune) or someone who does. :-)

    Have Fun!
