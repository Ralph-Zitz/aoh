SYNOPSIS
       #include <config.h>
       #include <weather.h>
       #include <nightday.h>

       NIGHTDAY->...


IMPORTANT
       This server is the official reference for the current daystate.
       Do not implement own daystates in your servers (or be sure to
       have a damn good reason to do so!).
       It may only be queried, not cloned nor inherited.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the default weather server for all outdoor rooms with
       no own weather server. 
       Its idea of weather is (currently) just the change between day
       and night: its weather states exactly match the various
       daystates.

       Internally it just overloads StartServer() and InitStates() to
       initialize P_STATES with a proper set of statedata.

       The /std/weather's InitStates() queries /obj/nightday for its
       P_STATES to initialize itself.
