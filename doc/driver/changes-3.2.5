10-Dec-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.5
    - Collapsing of '/' in object names also used for inherits.
    - Default limit for bitstrings is 6144 bits.
    - The efuns break_point() and swap() are disabled by default.
    - Pre-release versions have an extended version number of
        the form '3.2.5-dev.16'.
    - Compat mode drivers define __COMPAT_MODE__ (meant to replace
        COMPAT_FLAG eventually); native mode drivers define
        __NATIVE_MODE__.
        Similar, a driver using euids defines __EUIDS__.
    - New defines __ERQ_MAX_SEND__ and __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__ when the
        driver supports the ERQ. The values are the max sizes of
        the send and receive buffers.
    - MSDOS support removed (the MSDOS filesystem however is still
        supported).
    - It is now possible to use '..' in filenames as long as it
        doesn't has the 'parent directory' meaning (that means, 'foo..bar'
        is ok, bug 'foo/../bar' is not).
    - When a connection is closed, the driver no longer sends
        'Closing down' as last text.
    - Bugfix: branches in bigger lambda() closures use the correct
        branch offsets. I am not completely sure if the bugfix is
        correct, so I left in two 'DEBUG:' diagnostics with information
        needed to debug the code further if necessary.
    - Bugfix: the commandline parser printed a faulty error message
        if a required value was missing.
    - Bugfix: mapping_contains() freed the wrong values, clobbering
        passed mapping literals.
    - Bugfix: After an UDP packet was processed, the evaluation costs
        are restored.
    - Bugfix: The LPC compiler now accepts only regular files for includes.
    - Bugfix: If a npc was destructed between to command() calls, and
        the H_MODIFY_COMMAND hook was set to a string, the driver called
        the named modify-command function on the destructed npc.
    - Bugfix: During the execution of a closure, an extra refcount is
        added to protect it from destruction while it is executed. This
        is primarily a safety measure for the driver hooks which only
        have 1 refcount and are thus very sensitive against master object
        updates.
    - Bugfix: Under some OS like Linux, the normal SIG_IGN handler is
        just one-shot. To reliably ignore signals (ie SIGPIPE), a homemade
        handler is used.
    - Bugfix: regreplace("acc", "a*", "yy",1) trashed memory.
    - Bugfix: runtime errors in an alien-lfun-closure (as created by
        symbol_function() calls) no longer crash the driver during the
        error handling.
    - Bugfix: sprintf() on big floats or in long fields no longer causes
        a buffer overrun (and should it happen nevertheless, a proper
        fatal() is generated).
