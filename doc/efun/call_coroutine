SYNOPSIS
        mixed call_coroutine(coroutine cr, mixed value = 0)

DESCRIPTION
        Continues execution of the coroutine.

        The value will be passed as the result of its last suspension
        point (the previous yield() call of its execution). If the
        coroutine is at its start, the value will be discarded.

        The coroutine may pass execution to other coroutines through
        await() and yield() calls. A yield() call without a coroutine,
        a return statement or simply the end of the statement block
        will return to the caller.

        The result of the call will be the value given to the yield()
        or return statement.

HISTORY
        Coroutines were introduced in LDMud 3.6.5.
