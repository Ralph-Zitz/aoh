SYNOPSIS
        int check_type(mixed arg, lpctype type)

DESCRIPTION
        Returns 1 if the first argument <arg> fulfills the type <type>,
        0 otherwise.

        This check is similar to runtime type checks. The target type
        doesn't need to match exactly, but a variable of that type should
        be able to hold the argument.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.6.7
