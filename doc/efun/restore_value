SYNOPSIS
        mixed restore_value(string str)

DESCRIPTION
        Decode the string representation <str> of a value back into the value
        itself and return it. <str> is a string as generated by save_value().

        The '#x:y' version specification of the saveformat is optional,
        however the driver will assume the old format version 0 in this case.
        It is strongly recommended to regard the version specification as
        non-optional in newly saved values.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.8.
        LDMud 3.2.9 added the restoring of non-lambda closures, symbols,
        and quoted arrays, using a new savefile format version.
        LDMud 3.5.0 added the possibility to restore version 2 with its higher
        float precision.
