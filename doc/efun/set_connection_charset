SYNOPSIS
        void set_connection_charset (int* bitvector, int quote_iac)
        void set_connection_charset (string charset, int quote_iac)

DESCRIPTION
        Set the set of characters that can be output to the
        interactive user (this does not apply to binary_message() ).
        The function must be called by the interactive user object
        itself.

        The charset can be given either directly as a string, or
        indirectly as a bitvector.

        The bitvector is interpreted as an array of 8-bit-values and
        might contain up to 32 elements. Character n is allowed to be
        output if sizeof(bitvector) > n/8 && bitvector[n/8] & (1 << n%8) .

        If quote_iac is 0 and char 255 is allowed to be output, IAC
        will be output unmodified.
        If quote_iac is 1 and char 255 is allowed to be output, char
        255 will be quoted so that it is not interpreted as IAC by the
        telnet protocol.

HISTORY
        Introduced in 3.2.1@40.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added the ability to specify the charset as a string.
