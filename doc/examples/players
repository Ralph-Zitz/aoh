DESCRIPTION
        Interactive objects have a connection object attached to it.
        These objects are typically called players.

EXAMPLES
        #include <configuration.h>

        /* To setup an interactive player
         * write master::connect() like this:
         */
        object connect()
        {
            object obj;
            ...


            /* Establish a mud-wide default for a maximum command rate */
            configure_interactive(this_object(),
                IC_MAX_COMMANDS, 100);


            /* In a screen-oriented editor, most of the printable
             * characters (excluding answers to editor prompts
             * 'j', 'n' and 'q') can be combined into strings.
             */
            configure_interactive(this_object(),
                IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_STRING,
                "abcdefghijklmoprstuvwxz0123456789"
                "ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPRSTUVWXZ");

            /* To disable any previous setting, just call: */
            configure_interactive(this_object(),
                IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_STRING, "");


            /* Upon return from the the function, the connection
             * with its modified max_commands will be rebound
             * from the master object to the returned object.
             */
            return obj;
        }
