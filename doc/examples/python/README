DESCRIPTION
        These are examples for the Python interface of LDMud:


        startup.py

            This module loads all the other modules and offers
            a python_reload() efun to reload all the other
            modules.


        console.py
        console.c

            A python console for LPC. Via input_to entered commands
            are sent to the Python module to interpret them and
            return its result. (Without any security guards in-place
            that module is a VERY BIG security hole.)


        asyncore_patch.py
        echo.py

            Demonstrates how to patch the asyncore module to work
            with the LDMud select loop to watch for sockets.
            The echo module is the same as in the asyncore documentation.


HISTORY
        LDMud 3.5 implemented the python functionality.
