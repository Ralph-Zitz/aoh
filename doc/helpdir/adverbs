SYNOPSIS
    adverbs
    set_adverb <abbreviation>,<adverb>

DESCRIPTION
    The grammatical definition of an adverb is 'a word which modifies
    a verb or adjective'. In OSB you use adverbs to explain 'how' you
    do something. For example, you can laugh 'merrily', 'evilly', 'sadly',
    'gaily', 'happily', 'loudly', etc. These are all adverbs.
    
    The soul (which helps you emote) allows you to use adverbs in two
    ways. First, it allows you to use abbreviations for commonly used
    adverbs. There is a list built into the soul, but you can modify
    these plus add your own adverbs. For example, if you type 'grin dem',
    your friends will see 'Blubber grins demonically.' To see the list of 
    predefined adverbs, just type 'adverbs'.
    
    Secondly, the soul allows you to have preset adverbs (or adverbial 
    clauses) which are connected to certain verbs. For example, if you type 
    'laugh', the adverb connected to laugh is 'fall down laughing'. Or, if 
    you type 'grin', the soul adds the preset adverb for grin, 'evilly'.
    To learn more about customizing the soul, type 'help soul'.    
    
    You can easily redefine any of the predefined adverbs by typing
        set_adverb <abbreviation>,<adverb>
    For example, 'the' gets expanded to 'theoretically' by the soul. If
    you want 'the' to stay 'the' in your emotes, type 'set_adverb the,the'.
    The abbreviation must only be 3 letters long, but the adverb may be
    as long as you like.

    You can use adverbs also to abbreviate rather longish names, such as
    "Organimedes". If you have typed
	    set_adverb org,organimedes
    the command "wave org" would produce "You wave at Organimedes.".
