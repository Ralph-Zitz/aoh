Alignment:

Alignment shows if you are good or evil. You start with a neutral
alignment. If you kill evil monsters, your alignment will change towards
good. If you kill good creatures, for example other good players, you
will become evil. It is known that both alignments, good and evil, must
exist to keep the balance.
