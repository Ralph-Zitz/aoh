SYNOPSIS
  bug <textline>
  bug <object>: <textline>

DESCRIPTION
  The command lets you tell the wizards that something does not work
  properly and that they should look into it.

  In the first form, it refers to your current environment, in
  the second form to an object lying around or carried in your inventory.

  Note that in the second form _no_ spaces are allowed before the ':'.
  The object is searched for first in your environment, then in your
  inventory. Use the keyword 'my' or adjectives to unambigously specify 
  an object.

  Please do not hesitate to use this command - nothing is perfect and
  bug messages are always welcome. Be precise about the problem - say
  exactly what you did and what did or did not happen.
  
  Please note, however, that bug messages are not sent to all wizards 
  online! They are instead stored in a central file. If you have found 
  a bug which is urgent, find a wizard who is online and tell them directly.

EXAMPLES
  Bug messages referring to the room you are in:
    bug This room has no exits!
    bug I got a wrongness in space message when i opened the door!

  Bug messages referring to an object:
    bug sword: It got blunt after just one stroke.
    bug my sword: This got blunt, too.
