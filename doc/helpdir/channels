SYNOPSIS
	channels

DESCRIPTION
	Channels are a way of communicating messages to the whole mud. Although
	shouts can also tell something to the whole mud, it is considered nicer
	to use the channels, since you can turn off a channel if it bores you,
	but you can't turn off shouts if they bore you.
	
	Everything that you say on a channel can be heard by anyone listening
	to that channel. Each channel has a different topic or purpose. 
	
   Type 'channels' to see all the available channels. This also shows you 
	which channels you have on and which you have off.
	
	To use a channel, always type '=' plus the name of the channel. For
	example, if you want to say something on the help channel, type
	
	    =help Hey, I really need some help here!
	    
	Everyone who has the help channel on will then see
	
	    [Blubber:help] Hey, I really need some help here!
	    
	The players channel is the only exception to this rule; you only have to
	type '=' to access it.

	Some of the more interesting channels are:

	o players
	  The general channel for players. Use it for anything general related
	  to the game.

	o help 
	  Here you can ask for help.
	  
	o newbie 
	  A special channel for newbies to ask newbie questions.
	   
	o news 
	  This is a channel only for announcements - you can't send any
	  messages on it.
	
	o intermud
	  This sends messages to MUDs which use the mudlink system for
	  communication between different MUDs.
