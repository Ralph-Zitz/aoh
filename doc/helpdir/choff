SYNOPSIS
    choff
    choff <channel name>

DESCRIPTION
    The command 'choff <channel name>' allows you to turn off a selected
    channel. When the channel is off, you won't receive any messages sent
    on it. Use 'chon <channel name>' to turn a channel back on.
    
    Typing 'choff' by itself will temporarily turn off all of your channels.
    You can then type 'chon' to turn those channels back on which you 
    previously had on.
