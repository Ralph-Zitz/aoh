SYNOPSIS
	color

	color <class> clear
	color <class> <bold>|<normal>

DESCRIPTION
	With the color command you can custom color different kinds of
	output One Step Beyond sends to you. Currently this only works
	for VT100/ANSI-terminals and if you set 'stty ansi'/'stty vt100'.

	With the parameter 'chart' it shows you how the different color-
	combinations look like at your terminal.

	There are two general ways of using the command:

	Without any parameters it prints out your current definitions.

	With paramters you can set the color for the 'class' type of 
	output to the color you give. The syntax looks a bit wiered,
	but is rather easy, look at the examples below.

	Currently the following classes are available:
	
	default       : Any output you did not define a special color for
	tell          : All tells you receive
	say           : All says
	channel       : Anything that is written on channels
	emote         : All emotes 
	combat        : All combat messages about your enemy
	combat_self   : All combat messages about you
	combat_others : All combat messages about others fighting
        room_exit     : All exits and doors

	Valid colors are:
	black, red, green, yellow, blue, purple, cyan and white.

	Each foreground color can be bright or not. A funny side effect of
	this is that 'bright black' is actually grey .)
	Background colors cannot be bright.

	For vt100 terminals you can specify normal or bold text instead
	of the colors.

EXAMPLES
	Set the default color to a bright white on blue background:

	color default bright white on blue

	Set the channel message color to a bright red:

	color channel bright red
	(if you do not give a background color, the default one is used)

	Set the tell message color to a bright cyan on black background

	color tell bright cyan on black

	Set the room_exits bold for vt100 terminal

	color room_exit bold
