DYING

  Dying occurs when you go below 0 hit points. When this happens you
  leave your body and become a ghost. To become solid again, you must
  go to a church and pray. If you are far off in the wilderness, you
  can command 'goto church' and will be transported to the church in
  some nice place.
  When you are alive again, you will still be the same level, but will
  have lost 1/3 of your experience, all of your money, and all of your
  possessions.  The money and possessions will still be carried by
  your corpse, which (if it hasn't been picked up by another player)
  will be wherever you got killed.
