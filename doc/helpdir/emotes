SYNOPSIS
    emotes
    (also called "pages" or "socials" in some MUDs)

    emote <text>
    me <text>
    : <text>
            
    :: <text>
    ; <text>
        
    I <text>   (that's capital i)
    . <text>

DESCRIPTION
    The soul offers several ways of emoting.
    
    The first way is to use the built-in emotes. If you type 'grin',
    you will see: 
      'You grin evilly.' 
    and other players will see:
      'Bilbo grins evilly.' 
    
    You can see the list of built-in emotes
    if you type 'verbs'. It is also possible to customize these
    verbs. Type 'help soul' to see how to do this.

    You may emote in the third person.
       "me hates writing souls."
    This would result in
       "<yourname> hates writing souls."
    The commands 'emote' and ':' are equivalent to 'me'.

    Variations are:
        "::'s sword is broken." 
    and "; sword is broken."
    both result in
        "<yourname>'s sword is broken."

    Some people consider emoting in the third person unnatural. For this
    reason, you can also emote in the first person. This has the additional
    advantage that the echo you get is what it ought to be.
	    "I hate writing souls."
    results in
	    "You hate writing souls."
    The command '.' is equivalent to 'I'.

    Emotes are not sent to NPCs.
