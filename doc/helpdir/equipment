SYNOPSIS
  equipment

DESCRIPTION 
  Shows you what kind of weapons and armour you are wielding and
  wearing.

EQUIPMENT
  There are two kinds of objects in your inventory: those you just
  carry around, and those you actually use. The latter are called
  'equipment'. 
  Equipment objects are special in that they are not part of 'do
  all'-commands like 'drop all', 'sell all' and that. To include
  equipment in such commands, you either have to stop using it, or
  command 'sell really all' or 'drop really all'.

  Wielded weapons and worn armours are automatically considered
  equipment. You can declare other things as equipment using the
  'equip' command, e.g. 'equip with torch' would declare a torch being
  an equipment object. You can recall this by 'lay torch aside'.

  Equipment can be dropped or put away for a while. For example after
  equipping yourself with the torch you can command 'drop torch
  really' in case you need a free hand, and later 'take the torch' and
  it will still be your equipment.
