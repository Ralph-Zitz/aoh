SYNOPSIS
    examine
    examine <object>

DESCRIPTION
    Examine your surroundings (first form) or a specific object
    (second form). The object can be either in your inventory or lying 
    around. If <object> matches several objects in your room or inventory, 
    just the first one found is selected and shown.

    It is possible to look into bags or other containers which hold things:
        'examine gem in bag'. 
    It is also possible to look at several things at once: 
        'examine bolt and the nuts here'.

    To examine oneself, use 'me' or 'myself' as object.

    The command may abbreviated to just 'exa'.

    This is a more thorough inspection than the simple 'look at'.
    However, if there is nothing special to see, 'examine' will tell
    you and behave like 'look at'.
