FAQ or Frequently Asked Questions

 
> It's dark outside...I can't see anything.
> It's too bright ...I can't see anything.  - What now ?
Light a torch or wear sunglasses.
(in some guilds you have spells to create light or darkness.)
 
> I always get lost..what can I do
Use pencil and paper to draw a map ;-) 
 
> I am dead ! What now ???
You are now a ghost. So go to a church, an altar, a temple (usually your 
starting room) and 'pray' there.
Then you are resurrected and you can go back to your corpse to get
your stuff back.
The bad thing is that you will loose lots of experience points (XP).
On the other hand, being a ghost has its own advantages...
If you are lost, the command 'goto church' will transport you to the church
I think.

> Do i keep my stuff when i leave the game ?
Umm..You keep your money and some special items (so-called autoloads,
like the quicktyper) when you 'quit'. When you 'petrify' to leave the 
game you keep even all your other equipment until the mud is rebooted 
or crashes. In this case you get some money back for your lost equipment
as if you have sold everything before.

> Can I learn magic spells, achieve skills and improve my character ?
Yes.
For example a sorcerer can learn all kind of spells, a fighter
has lots of special fighting skills.

> What guilds are there to choose from?
There's quite a few.
 
> Can i have a second character ?
Sure you can :-)
However, as each character uses up resources, create second characters
only if you can also role-play them. Just-for-fun seconds are bad style.

> Am I allowed to help other players ?
> Can I go together with a friend on a quest ?
Yes you are :-) It is explicitly appreciated that players help each
other... You can give quest-hints, money, equipment and more
to other players to help them (although please think about
it if it is really necessary to trade complete quest-solutions).
By the way, it's more fun to solve a quest together with other people !!
But remember, though most players are willing to share extra equipment
with you, pestering them with requests will just lead to them ignoring
you. This is especially valid after a reboot when noone has equipment
left.
And as wizards are not allowed to help anyway, it's no use asking them.

> Is PlayerKilling allowed here ?
Basically the answer is "No". There are however specially marked
PlayerKilling Zones.

> What does this "Your sensitive mind..." - message mean ?
Oh well..this means some dumb wizard produced some buggy code..
Actually wizards get a detailed error-message instead.
Leave a bug-message or if you think it is important tell a wizard,
and expect that the error will be fixed within 5 years.
 
> What is mudmail ??
Almost every city has a post office. Go there and type
'mail <player>' to send an email to someone in OSB
or 'read mail' to check the mail you got.
 
> What is a newbie, npc, a hlp, Mud...
Ok some abbreviations:
newbie: That's probably you. It is someone who is new in a Mud.
npc: Non-Player-Character, a character which is part of the game
hlp: High-level-player, a player with level > 20, whom you
     can ask for help in OSB
Mud: Multi User Dungeon
 
> How do I talk to npcs ?
Usually 'ask <npc> about <key-word>', e.g.
'ask angela about necklace'. Sometimes you need to 'say'
things, like 'say yes'.
 
> How can I find out when someone has been on the last time
Do 'tfinger <player>'
 
> I have a problem and I can't find the answer here...
- Just ask other players, either by 'tell <player> <text>' or on 
  the channel with '= <text>'
- If you think your question is of general interest
  then mail or tell the author of this FAQ, as he will be glad 
  about all suggestions to improve it...


> I heard there is a news system in OSB.  What is this about and
  how can I use it.
In all guilds there are boards where you can read news and post
your own note. Do 'l board' and 'help board' there.
