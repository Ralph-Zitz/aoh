SYNOPSIS
  help <command>
  help <topic>
  
  help <object>
  
  help here
  
DESCRIPTION
  The first two forms of the command display information about the <command>
  or <topic> in question. If no argument is specified at all, the general
  help page is displayed.
  
  The third form of the command queries an object for special information,
  e.g. about it's use. However, not every object has something special to
  know.
  
  Help here shows you any special help in public rooms with special functions, 
  like the post office, pubs, or guilds.
