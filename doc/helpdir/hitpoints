HIT POINTS:
This is how much life you have left.  When someone hits you, your hit
points go down.  If you go below zero, you die (see the help on
dying).  Your hit points regenerate with time.  They regenerate faster
when drunk, and the very act of drinking some potent drinks will (in
addition to making you drunk) restore some points immediately. If you
get hungry or thirsty, the regenerating will stop, until you eat and
drink. If you become starving, or drying out, your hit points will
(slowly) trickle towards some very low limit (though you won't
actually die of starvation in this world).
