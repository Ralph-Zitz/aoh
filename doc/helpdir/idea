SYNOPSIS
  idea <textline>
  idea <object>: <textline>

DESCRIPTION
  The command allows to issue a single-lined message about an idea of
  yours to the wizards.

  In the first form, it refers to the players current environment, in
  the second form to an object lying around or carried by the player.

  Note that in the second form _no_ spaces are allowed before the ':'.
  The object is searched first in the environment, then in the
  player's inventory. Use the keyword 'my' or adjectives to
  unambigously specify an object.

  Please do not hesitate to use this command - fresh ideas are always welcome.

EXAMPLES
  Ideas referring to the room:
    idea A table might be useful here.
    idea And more : a chair would come handy as well.

  Ideas referring to an object:
    idea shell: Why can't I listen to it?
    idea my peanut: Salty peanuts would be nice.
