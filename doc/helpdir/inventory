SYNOPSIS
    inventory
    inventory [flat] [list] [long]
    inventory equip[ment]


DESCRIPTION
    The command 'inventory' (or just 'i') will show you all the items you 
    are carrying.
    
    Normally, your inventory contents are listed in 2 columns. If you want
    to see it all instead in one big long list, use 'inventory list'.
    
    Inventory normally shows you the contents of bags or other containers
    (indented in the list). If you don't want to see the contents, use
    'inventory flat'.
    
    If you are carrying more than one item with the same description, you'll
    see the description only once, plus a number in brackets to indicate
    how many of these you are carrying. For example, if you are carrying
    3 torches, and you type inventory, you'll see
        torch [3]
    If you want to see each and every object, use 'inventory long'.
    
    Of course, two swords called 'mighty two-hander' might in fact be
    very different, but that's what 'look' is for.
    
    If you want to see only your worn armour, wielded weapons and other
    equipment, use the command 'inventory equipment' (or 'equip').
