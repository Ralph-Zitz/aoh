Try to focus your killing on monsters and permanent 
inhabitants of One Step Beyond, not other players.

There will be a flag for killers.  In other words, 
you will be able to choose to be a renegade and
kill other renegades, but you won't be able
to kill those players that choose non-renegade
as their style of play.
