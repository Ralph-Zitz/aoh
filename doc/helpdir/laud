SYNOPSIS
    laud <textline>
    laud <object>: <textline>

DESCRIPTION
    This command allows you to praise a room or an object, saving your comments 
    for the wizards to read later.

    Use 'laud <bla bla bla>' to praise the room you are standing in.
    
    Use the second form, 'laud <object>: <bla bla bla>' to praise an object
    which is either in your inventory or is lying around in the room you are
    presently in.

    Please note that in the second form _no_ spaces are allowed before the ':'.
    The object will first be looked for in the room you're in, secondly in your
    inventory. If you add 'my' ('laud my rose: what a cool rose!'), then the
    room won't be searched for the object.
        
    Don't hesitate to use this command - wizards like praise as much as
    anybody else!

    (We know that 'praise' would be a better name for this command, but the
    soul already uses 'praise' for its own purposes.)

EXAMPLES
    Praising a room:

    Praise an object:
      laud matrix: A really useful item.
