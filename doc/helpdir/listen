COMMAND
    listen
    listen [to] <object>

DESCRIPTION
    The command 'listen' allows you to hear any sounds which might
    be audible.
    
    You can also listen to objects which might either be in the room
    you're standing in or which you are carrying in your inventory.
    For example, 'listen to seashell' or 'listen waves'. The 'to' is 
    optional.
    
    It's also possible to listen into containers ('listen into bag' -
    odd but it works) or to listen to more than one thing at once,
    such as 'listen to lion and birds'.
