SYNOPSIS
    look
    look [at] <object>
    look [at] <detail> on <object>

    look for <object>

DESCRIPTION
    Look at the surrounding (first form), at a specific object
    (second form) or at a detail on a specific object (third form).
    The object may be carried or lying around. If <object> would match
    several real objects, just the first object found is selected and shown.

    To see, what objects would match a given description, use the last
    form.

    It is possible to look into bags and/or several objects at once.
    Example: 'look at gem in bag', 'look at bolt and the nuts here'.

    To look at oneself, use 'me' or 'myself' as object.

    The command may abbreviated to just 'l'.

    Note that a simple look may not reveal all informations about an
    object. A closer examination might be useful.
