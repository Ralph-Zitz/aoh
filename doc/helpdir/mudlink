DESCRIPTION
    Mudlink is an informal network of muds which allows you to
    communicate with anyone in one of the other connected muds.
    
    Via mudlink connections you can:
    
    o  see a list of muds connected to the mudlink with the command
       'rpeers'
    o  see who is logged into another mud using 'rwho <mudname>'
    o  send tells to someone in another mud using the command 
       'tell <player>@<mudname>' resp. 'tell "<player>@<mud name>"'
    o  finger people at other muds (only if their mudlink is 
       correctly installed however!)
    o  find your friends at other muds by using the 'rlocate' command
    o  send mails to a player at another mud (again, only if their
       mudlink connection is set up to do this)
