SYNOPSIS
    news

DESCRIPTION
    One Step Beyond has a system of newsboards to help facilitate
    communication between all players and wizards. These boards
    are scattered throughout the MUD for you to read notes and post
    your own ideas or suggestions for everyone to read.
    
    There are, like in Usenet, different newsgroups, each with their
    own topic. Many boards carry more than one newsgroup. The players 
    group is meant for all general communication about the game, and 
    any player or wizard can read or post to it. There are also other
    specialized groups for posting about selected topics. For example,
    many guilds have their own newsgroups for their members; non-members 
    may or may not be able to read these notes.
    
    If you wish to write about something that only concerns a small
    group of people, it may be better to use mail and cc: it to the
    group.
