SYNOPSIS
  petrify

DESCRIPTION
  Quit the game, but without losing your character (technically the
  same as going netdead). This means that when you enter the game
  again next time, you will start where you petrified with all your
  possessions.

  Guests can't petrify, they will always quit.

  Note that this won't work if the game crashes or reboots meanwhile.
  In that case you'll receive a (partial) compensation for the value
  you lost with your possessions.

SEE ALSO
  save, quit
