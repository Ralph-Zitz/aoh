SYNOPSIS

  privacy, snooping

DESCRIPTION

  We, the wizards of One Step Beyond, absolutely respect players' wishes 
  for privacy, and will take all possible means to safeguard it within
  reason.
  
  Our snooping policy is as follows: You, the player, should assume that
  your privacy is guaranteed so long as you follow what we consider to
  be acceptable behaviour. Once you overstep this boundary, you forfeit
  this guarantee.
  
  The most serious form of overstepping this boundary is in harassment
  of other players. We expect players to behave in an adult and responsible
  manner, and to treat people both as you would like to be treated, and
  as you would treat them in the real world. Harassment includes, but is
  not limited to, using profanity or derogatory language; sexist or racist
  behaviour or language; or preventing someone else from enjoying OSB.
  Use your head. Be responsible. This is a game, and we'd all like to 
  enjoy it.
  
  Snoops are always notified to the player unless a wizard needs to act
  in cases such as harassment. In such cases, snooping will not be
  notified, but it will be logged in a special file that all wizards can
  read. We feel that trust between players and wizards is absolutely
  essential to a good MUD atmosphere, and that you the player should
  not be concerned that wizards are snooping your private conversations
  just for the fun of it. 
  
  Players also have the option of disallowing notified snoops if they
  wish. Remember that notified snoops can be extremely helpful to wizards 
  when they are hunting for bugs.
  
  We hope you enjoy your time in One Step Beyond.
