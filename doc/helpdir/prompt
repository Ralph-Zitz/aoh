SYNOPSIS
	prompt [<prompt-description>]

DESCRIPTION
	Without any argument you'll see your current prompt.
	If you give a prompt-description it will serve as prompt for
	you in the future. Only some special strings will be replaced
	by data like your XP for example.
	These strings are:
	  $h - Your current hitpoints.
	  $H - Your maximum hitpoints.
	  $s - Your current spellpoints.
	  $S - Your maximum spellpoints.
	  $x - Your current XP.
	  $t - The time in the format: hh:mm.
	  $T - The time in the format: hh:mm:ss.
          $n - a newline        

	And wizards may use:
	  $d - Your current directory.
	  $p - Your current path (shortened).
	  $P - Your current path (long).
	  $c - The evalcost of your last command.
          $e - The filename of your current environment
        

EXAMPLES
	prompt HP: $h($H), SP: $s($S)>
	will result in:
	HP: 15(50), SP: 50(50)>

	and

	prompt [Wessex@OSB, $t]
	will result in:
	[Wessex@OSB, 18:32]
