DESCRIPTION

      Quests are neat journeys that you go on and try to 
      solve a riddle or task.

      They require wit and wisdom, and sometimes a bit
      of good old fashioned killing.

      For your reward, besides the intrinsic feeling of
      helping the community with your good deed, you
      will receive a special quest object to help in
      future endeavors and/or quest points which help
      to remind you how many quests you've done so far.

      Pretty much the quests are designed to make 
      game play more interesting.  Without them the
      strengthening of your character and mudding in 
      general would might get repetitive.

      Not all quests are perfect of course, as it is
      easy to overlook basics.  If you come across a
      quest that you think is illogical, supplies too
      few clues or simply sucks, please use the 'idea'
      command and make a note of it.

      On the other hand, if a quest is particularly
      well written and its got you so excited that you
      haven't left the computer for 2 days, well, first
      take a long break, then come back and use the
      'laud' command to compliment the wizard.
