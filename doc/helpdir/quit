SYNOPSIS
    quit

DESCRIPTION
    Typing 'quit' will cause you to immediately leave the game. All the
    objects you carry will be dropped in the room you stand in (except
    for autoloading items - these you always keep). When you reenter
    the game, you will start at your "home" or set entry location.
    
    It is possible to choose a different home at special places in the
    game. Some towns and guilds offer this possibility.
    
    Your stats will always be saved when you quit. You may also type
    'save' anytime during game play.
    
    If you wish to keep your items and position but still leave the game,
    use 'petrify' instead of quit.
