DESCRIPTION
  The game has to reboot every once in a while, usually
  because it is taking up too much memory, and therefore
  causing lag.
  
  Sometimes we do reboots when a new concept has been
  introduced that affects the entire length and width
  of the mud, but hardly ever the depth.

  A bug can crash the game too, but it would have to
  be a sturdy specimen.

  All objects are destroyed in a shutdown and all you
  keep are 'autoloading' ones.  Players who get 
  destructed receive a small compensation.  Its
  usually best to sell all your junk and leave the
  game rather than get dested.
