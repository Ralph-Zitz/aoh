HOST RESTRICTION

    If the users of a certain site cause more annoyance than bearable,
    the site is restricted or even banished.
    
    If a site is restricted, only existing players can log in, new players
    are rejected. However, it is possible to request the creation of
    a new player via email to phil@osb.mud.de .
    The gamesmgr may or may not grant the request.
    
    If a site is banished, noone from that site may login anymore.
