SYNOPSIS
    smell
    smell [at] <object>

DESCRIPTION
    Smell the surrounding (first form) or a specific object (second
    form). The object may be carried or lying around.
    If <object> would match several real objects, just the first found
    is selected and smelled at.

    It is possible to smell into bags and/or several objects at once.
    Example: 'smell rose in bag', 'smell oil and gas'.

    To smell oneself, use 'me' or 'myself' as object.
