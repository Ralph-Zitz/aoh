    This rather longish document deals with the way you may configure your
    built-in soul. First, the commands are listed; afterwards, some of them
    are described in more detail.

    COMMANDS
    ========

    Command overview (these commands cannot be overloaded):
	verbs		--- show one or all defined verbs
	set_verb	--- add definition for a new verb
	del_verb	--- delete definition of an existing verb
	adverbs		--- show one or all defined adverbs
	set_adverb	--- add abbreviation for a new adverb
	del_adverb	--- delete existing abbreviation of an adverb
    Most of these commands explain themselves if you give a question mark
    as parameter, e.g. "set_verb ?".
	emote/me/:	--- emote in the third person
	I/.		--- emote in the first person

    The text below deals in more detail with the issuing of commands, the
    setting of verbs and adverbs, and the way to emote.
