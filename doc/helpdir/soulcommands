    ISSUING COMMANDS
    ================

    An emote can either be targeted or not. A targeted emote would be
    "smile wessex" since the target for your smile is Wessex.
    An untargeted emote would be "smile"; you would just smile happily
    (or however) then.

    The soul supports targeting in a rather primitive way. You can target
    emotes at one person at a time; that is, "smile wessex" will work
    properly (giving "You smile at Wessex."), but "smile mateese pepel"
    will not (and instead give "You smile at Mateese pepel.").
