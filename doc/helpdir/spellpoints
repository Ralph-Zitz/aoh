SPELL POINTS:
Spell points are used up as you cast spells or use the "tell" and
"shout" commands.  They regenerate with time, and some magic potions,
items, etc. may restore them faster (but normal alcohol does not).
When using tell and shout, spell points *can* go negative, however you
can't use those commands if you have negative spell points.
