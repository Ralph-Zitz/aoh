Starting out in LP-mud:

OK, basically what you want to do is get experience and coins.  You do
this by solving puzzles, killing monsters, and selling (after finding)
treasures.

You can move around with normal "e,w,n,s,u,d" types of commands.

You can collect different weapons and armour (and realize that you must wield 
and wear those, respectively).  If the monster doesn't attack you first, you 
can type something like "kill orc" and you'll start fighting.

If you get killed, you lose a third of your experience, and must go to your
church to pray.  Try not to have this happen.  Type "help wimpy" to get an
idea on how to avoid this, and "help dying" for details. Also, "score" will 
tell you how you're doing as far as health, intoxication, etc.

type "help" for a basic list of commands.  Have fun!
