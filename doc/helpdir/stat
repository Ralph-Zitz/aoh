SYNOPSIS
    stats

DESCRIPTION
    Every player has four stats defined:

      Str - Strength, affects your carrying capacity.
      Dex - Dexterity, affects you fighting ability.
      Int - Intelligence, affects your spellcasting ability.
      Con - Constitution, affects you health.
      
    You can raise your stats in your guild. You usually pay for this
    with experience points (XP).
    
    Some guilds implement guild stats, such as wisdom or charisma.

    The command 'score stats' will give information about your current stats.
    You can see your stats when you type 'score'.
