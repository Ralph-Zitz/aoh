Every player has four basic stats defined:

Str - Strength, affects your carrying capacity and fighting strength.
Con - Constitution, affects you health and regeneration rate.
Int - Intelligence, affects your learning ability (spells, skills, SP)
Wis - Wisdom, affects your knowledge of the magic arts and your SP
Agi - Agility
Qui - Quickness
Cha - Charisma, affects your influence on other livings (trade, chat) 

// Outdated
Dex - Dexterity, affects you fighting ability.=(Agi+Qui)/2

The range of the stats is 0..100 where 75 is a good average value

HP - Hitpoints, how much woudned you are (<0, dead, 1000 fully healty)
SP - Spellpoints, how much magic energy you have left
PEP- Physical Endurancepoints, how much actions you can do (fight)
MEP - Mental Endurancepoints, how much mental action you can do (spells)

These values can be raised in the guild office by paying excessive 
experience points, points above your current level. The command 
'score' will give information about your current stats.
Note: How to raise the stats is yet unclear

You raise these stats independently of your level in the adventurers 
guild. NB! Your sp-max and hp-max will NOT go up when you raise your 
level. You must raise the corresponding stat as well to accomplish that.
