COMMAND
       stop [[attack] | hunt | cast | ? ]

The 'stop' command is used to stop different actions. If you
use the command without any arguments 'stop attack' is used.

stop [attack]     Stops current attacking.
stop hunt         Stops all hunts.
stop cast         Tries to stop current spellcasting.

This command is useful if you've decided not to kill a little
bunny rabbit, and maybe just beat the heck out of it and allow
someone else to kill it instead.
