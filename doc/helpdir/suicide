COMMAND
    suicide <open> 

DESCRIPTION
    This command allows you to happily kill yourself, which means
    you will remove your character from the game.  Just type suicide 
    by itself then, for verification, you are prompted for your 
    password. If you don't enter it, your character will remain.  

    This decision is final! Once removed, your character can't be
    restored!  Well, we probably could restore it, but we won't 
    because we're such meanies.

    Some systems only work if the password is visibly seen.  Type
    suicide open and it will allow you to write it visibly.  Then
    you can kill yourself.

    Be sure to swear a lot or something before you go, you know, just
    to cause a general ruckus.  We always enjoy that sort of thing.
