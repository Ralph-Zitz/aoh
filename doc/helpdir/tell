COMMAND

tell <player> <message>

  Send a message to a player. He can be anywhere in the game.
  You can abbreviate the name.  For example, 'tell so Hi buddy!' will
  tell sonic Hi buddy!  If both Sonic and Softbyte are both logged on
  you'll have to go tell son Hi! to indicate you mean Sonic.  Or heck,
  you can just type out Sonic's name in full, it won't hurt you.
