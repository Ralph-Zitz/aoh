COMMAND
    time
    time osb
    time rl

DESCRIPTION
    Displays the time according to your time settings. By default,
    new players see both OSB and real world time. You can use the
    config command to change what time you want to see.
    
    The time command also shows uptime.
    
    If you only want to see one specific time (osb or real world),
    use 'time osb' or 'time rl'.

    See the config help file to see how to change your time
    settings.
