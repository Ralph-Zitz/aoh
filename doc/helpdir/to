COMMAND
	to =[<channelname>] <command>

DESCRIPTION
	Send an emote <command> on channel <channelname>.
	If the channelname is not given, the players channel is used.
	Using this command, one can easily send emotes without
	resorting to the basic channel-emote '=='... of course, it
        really doesn't make a difference one way or the other.  I 
        think its easier to use == smiles but eh, if you wanna use
        'to' instead, hey go for it.

EXAMPLES
	to = smile bro  
	  -> produces [players:<yourname> smiles broadly]
	to =#sports poke Tune
	  -> produces [#sports:<yourname> pokes Tune]
