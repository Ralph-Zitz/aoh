COMMAND
  typo <textline>
  typo <object>: <textline>

DESCRIPTION
  The command allows to note a spelling error in a room's or object's
  description. The wizards will correct it immediately.  Immediately
  is usually defined as sometime between now and 5 years from now.

  In the first form, it refers to the players current environment, in
  the second form to an object lying around or carried by the player.

  Note that in the second form _no_ spaces are allowed before the ':'.
  The object is searched first in the environment, then in the
  player's inventory. Use the keyword 'my' or adjectives to
  specify an object that you may have more than one of.

  Please do not hesitate to use this command - wizards are notorious
  for their bad spelling.  What? Who wrote this, I can speel just fine
  thank you.

EXAMPLES
  Typos in rooms:
    typo The sign here:  It spells 'Chaos' incorrectly.
    typo This room:  It just sucks.

  Typos in objects:
    typo sword: It says it 'slices and dickes', I think it means 'dices'.
    typo my medallion: It's 'bronze', not 'bronse.'.
