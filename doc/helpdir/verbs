    VERBS
    =====

    Each definition of a verb consists of four parameters:
    1) the "verb" itself.
    2) a default "adverb" which is used in addition to the verb (usually,
       but see below) if there is no adverb given.
    3) an "additional string" which is used instead of the adverb if the
       emote is meant for another object.
    4) a flag (called "yesno") which determines if this emote can be used
       on other objects.

    Example:
    set_verb smile,happily,at,yes yields:
	verb		  = smile
	adverb		  = happily
	additional string = at
	yesno		  = yes
    If you type "smile", you will get: You smile happily.
    If you smile at a person	     : You smile at <person>
