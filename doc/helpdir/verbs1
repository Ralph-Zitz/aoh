    VERBS1

    Read 'help verbs' before you read the following, if you want
    any of it to make sense.  Or continue reading, lack of sense
    never hurt anyone.
    
    If the adverb or the additional string starts with a $ sign, the verb
    isn't used but only the adverb. Example:
    set_verb applaud,$ give a round of applause,to,yes
	verb		  = applaud
	adverb		  = $ give a round of applause
	additional string = to
	yesno		  = yes
    If you type "applaud", you will get: You give a round of applause.
	(instead of: You applaud give a round of applause.)
