    VERBS2

    If the adverb or the additional string starts with two $ signs, the
    subject of the sentence is not you. Example:
    set_verb blush,$$ cheeks are burning,,no
	verb		  = blush
	adverb		  = $$ cheeks are burning
	additional string =
	yesno		  = no
    If you type "blush", you will get: Your cheeks are burning.
	(instead of: You blush cheeks are burning.)

    There are some reserved adverbs:
	& : This action can only be performed on objects.
	@ : This action can only be performed on livings.

    If you are still unsure how to define new verbs, have a look at the
    original definitions with the command ``verbs <verb>'' or ask a
    wizard (who might be able to help you).
