COMMAND
    wear <object>

DESCRIPTION
    Wear an armour. For example, if you have a helmet, type wear
    helmet, and voila, you'll be wearing it.  To stop wearing an 
    armour, 'remove' it, or simply drop it.  

    You may wear just one armour type to cover a certain area of your
    body at once, for instance, only 1 helmet to cover your head, 
    unless of course you have more than 1 head.

    You can type 'wear all armours' to put on all your armours 
    at once, instead of going wear helmet, wear boots, wear cloak,
    etc.
