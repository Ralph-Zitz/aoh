COMMAND
    wield <object>

DESCRIPTION
    Wield a weapon. For example, if you have a knife in your 
    inventory, type 'wield knife', and voila, you're wielding it.
    To stop wielding a weapon, 'unwield' it, or simply drop it.
    
    If you have enough free hands, you may try to wield more than one
    weapon at once.  For instance, you can usually wield two knives
    since they are small weapons, but you can usually only wield
    one mighty battleaxe because its huge.
