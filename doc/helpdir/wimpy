COMMAND
	wimpy [HP]

DESCRIPTION
	This command sets the wimpy mode.  Type wimpy by itself to 
        show what your current wimpy status is.  Type wimpy <number>
        to set an exact hitpoint number.  For example, type 
        wimpy 20.

	This indicates that when your hitpoints fall to 20 or below,
	your character will run away from the battle automatically.
	Its a good command to use if your character is weak or if
	you're lagging like a bugger.
	
	Even with wimpy set you can still die, it just depends if
	the monster can drill you for over 20 hitpoints in 1 hit,
	thereby killing you before the automatic run away kicks in.
