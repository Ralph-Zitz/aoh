Congratulations, Ancient!

  You have now become a ancient (also called a superplayer). This is
OSB's way to acknowledge your achievements in playing.

  As a reward, you were equipped with some new commands giving you
more power for your life in OSB. But more power also gives you more
responsibility: you must not abuse your powers to help
players in situations which they are to master alone (like solving a
quest). In detail, you got these commands:
  title  people    invis     vis       goto    trans     echoto
  echo   echoall   force     heal      in      review
  snoop  earmuffs  man       shutdown  wizmode
Use the 'help' command for further explanation of them.

Some day, you might feel bored of just playing and want to create
rooms and things on your own. If this happens, ask a wizard to
introduce you into the secrets and demands of wizardhood.

                Have fun!
