Congratulations, Wizard!

  You have now become a wizard . By this promotion you are not a
player anymore. This means that you aren't allowed to do anything what
may affect the gameplay of normal players (like cloning or destructing
things, resetting rooms). If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask.
Read the rules (/doc/intro/WIZRULES) for more information.

  You'll see that we wizards in OSB pursue a relative open and
cooperative style of developing the mud. The text /doc/intro/linuxosb
explains a bit about the whys, and also points out some pitfalls of
this style. Though this text is quite long, reading it can save you from
some wear and tears in future.

  Information is the key to knowledge. Keep yourself informed - there
are lots of offers: several boards carrying actual information, 
the /doc directory containing vital informations about the mudlib, 
example objects and supplemental docs made by the other wizards, etc.

  Use your new commands to experiment. Don't hesitate to ask if you
want to know something not mentioned in the docs.

  Of course, if you decide that being a wizard is not as funny as you
expected it to be, you can become a player or ancient, no questions
asked.

  There is a doc containing some overall information. Read it immediately 
after finishing this text with the command 'more /doc/intro/basic'.

                Good Luck!
