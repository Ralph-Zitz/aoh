DESCRIPTION

  Result:
    A string with the complete detail description of this object, but
    without content.

  The result is catenated from P_LONG and the extra data associated
  with P_LONG. Actual objects may redefine ExaLong() as they please
  to.
  If P_LONG has no extra data for examine, "You see nothing special"
  plus the normal long description is used.
