LFUN
  #include <properties.h>

  int ExistsProp (string name [, int sc])
  mixed SetProp (string name, mixed arg [, int sc])

DESCRIPTION
  Checks if this object has a certain property.

  Arguments:
    name: the name of the property sought.
    sc  : if non-zero, only the 'soft property' is checked.

  Result:
    0 if the property doesn't exist, non-0 else.

  The function checks both for the existance of a lfun 'Query<name>'
  or an entry in the property-mapping. If <sc> is non-zero, just the
  mapping is checked.

IMPLEMENTED
