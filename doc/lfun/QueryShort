DESCRIPTION
	All objects must have a short description. This function returns
	a short string describing the thing. The string must be
	usable in every sentence. QueryShort() will be called from
	descriptive texts like:

	Wessex gives bottle of beer to beggar.

	All three nouns, Wessex, bottle of beer and beggar are
	just calls to QueryShort() in the specific object.

	If the first word of the short description is not a noun or
	proper name, it must be in lower case (!).
