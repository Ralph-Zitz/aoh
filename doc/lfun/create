LFUN
  void create ()

DESCRIPTION
  Initialise the object.

  If the object is first loaded by being inherited, this function will
  not be called first-hand, but instead create_inh().

EXAMPLE
  inherit "/some/object";
  void create () {
    ::create(); // Init inherited object as well
    SetProp("ImportantProp", 42);
  }

IMPLEMENTED
  /std/base, and any object needing it.
