LFUN
  void create_inh ()

DESCRIPTION
  Initialise the object, whatever that means.

  This function is only called when the object is first loaded by
  being inherited. However, /std/base::create_inh() calls create()
  then (for compatibility reasons).

  Reason is that inherited objects don't need to initialise anything -
  they just have to provide the code. Unfortunately this feature might
  break code in the existing mudlib, so it's effectively not activated
  at the moment.

EXAMPLE
  inherit "/some/object";
  void create_inh () {
    return; // No need to initialise anything.
  }

IMPLEMENTED
  /std/base, and any object needing it.
