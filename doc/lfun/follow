  void follow (string dest [, int method [, mixed extra ]])
  void follow (object dest [, int method [, mixed extra ]])

DESCRIPTION
  Let this object follow some object.

  Arguments:
    dest  : the destination to follow to.
    method: the move-method to use.
    extra : extra data given to the move.

  If this object is a follower of some object, every move of that
  object will a cause to this object's follow().
  Normal use is to let e.g. cats run after their owner, but this
  mechanism can also be used to let tools be notified about every move
  of their owner.

  Default behaviour of /std/thing/moving is to move into the same
  <dest> as the other object, unless P_NOFOLLOW is set.

IMPLEMENTED
  /std/thing/moving
