NAME
	lfun

DESCRIPTION
	This directory describes the functions implemented by
	One Step Beyond's objects. It is to serve as reference when you now
	a function in general, but forgot their details.

	Besides the function descriptions, there are <name>.x files in
	this directory as well. These are index files listing the lfun
	implemented by a certain object <name> (e.g. 'base.x' lists
	all lfuns implemented by /std/base).

	Note that you won't find the Query<prop>() and Set<prop>()
	functions here, they are implicitely documented with their
	properties in /doc/prop.
