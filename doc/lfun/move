  #include <moving.h>
  int move (string dest [, int method [, mixed data ]] )
  int move (object dest [, int method [, mixed data ]] )

DESCRIPTION
  Move this object to a destination.

  Arguments:
    dest  : the destination to move to.
    method: the move method to use: 
              M_SILENT, M_NOCHECK, M_GO, M_TELEPORT, M_SPECIAL
              M_PUT, M_DROP, M_GET, M_GIVE
    data  : extra data in case the move method needs further
            information.

  Result:
    ME_NO_MOVE      : general error, also default if move() is not
                      defined.
    ME_OK           : move succeeded.
    ME_DESTRUCTED_SELF: object was destructed while moving.
    ME_NO_LEAVE     : was not allowed to leave current env.
    ME_NO_ENTER     : was denied entering for unknown reason.
    ME_TOO_HEAVY    : dest cannot carry us.
    ME_NO_DROP      : can't drop
    ME_NO_GET       : can't take
    ME_NO_GIVE      : can't give
    ME_CAUGHT_ERR   : a runtime error occured during the move

  The function performs quite a number of checks before initiating the
  move, and notifications after it. Also, eventual followers are
  handled by calling their follow() lfun.

  The interpretation of the <data> relies heavily on the object
  moved, see their docs for more information.

  Moved objects also generate a message after the move, which is
  delivered to the old and new environment:

    MSG_MOVE <origin> <dest> <method> <data>

  <origin> and <dest> here are both object values.
