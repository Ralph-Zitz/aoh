LFUN
  int remove ()

DESCRIPTION
  Selfdestruct the called object (also called by gamedriver).

  Result:
    0 if the object did not selfdestruct, non-zero if it did.

  The function implemented in /std/base informs the environment by a
  call to prevent_leave() and notify_leave() that it is going to be
  destructed (move method 'M_DESTRUCT' with destination 0), then
  selfdestructs.

  Reason is to properly update all the transient data like weight or
  lighting.

EXAMPLE
  obj->remove()   destruct <obj>  

IMPLEMENTED
  /std/base
