SYNOPSIS
     public varargs string country(mixed what, mixed method)
	
DESCRIPTION
     If 'what' is an (string) ip_name or (string) ip_number then it returns 
     the country of the host location if it is known. Otherwise it will 
     return 'Unknown'.
     If given 'what' is a player-object it will return the country of the
     host the player is logged in from. If the object isn't a player or 
     doesn't exists anymore (because the player has logged out) the 
     function will return 0.
     If method is 0 then it returns only the country, otherwise the city
     and the country will be returned. 
     This function is used inside of the who command.
     Keep attention that the object which is using this function has an euid,
     because it may possible that you have to load "/lib/country".

EXAMPLES
     write("lib/country"->country("nova.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de")+"\n");
        
     Will print out Germany.

     write(country(find_player("mudlink"))+"\n");

     Will print out Germany, because Mudlink is logged in from Germany.
