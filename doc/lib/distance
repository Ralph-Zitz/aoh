PUBLIC FUNCTIONS


        int *VerifyCoordinates(mixed c)
        Either checks wether the coordinates are ok or reads out or if
        the argument is an object reads its coordinates and checks them
        
        Parameter:
          int *|object c=Coordinate array or room object
          
        Return Value:
          0: Faulty coordiantes, ({x,y,z})= Coordinate array

        int dist2D(mixed c1,mixed c2)
        Calculates the distance between two given coordinates which are
        either directly given or are read from the given room objects
        
        Parameter:
          c1,c2: int array of coordiantes ({x,y,z})
          c1,c2: room object whose coordinates are taken
          
        Return Value:
          Distance between the two points as a 2D projection,
          i.e. without considering the z-Coordinate

        int dist(mixed c1,mixed c2)
        Calculates the distance between two given coordinates which are
        either directly given or are read from the given room objects
        
        Parameter:
          c1,c2: int array of coordiantes ({x,y,z})
          c1,c2: room object whose coordinates are taken
          
        Return Value:
          Distance between the two points in full 3D
