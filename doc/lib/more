        u , b, - : last page
        f : go to the first page
        l : go to the last page
        <nr> : go to page <nr>
        /<regexp> : scan forward until line matching <regexp>
        / : repeats last /<regexp> command
        a : redisplay current page
        c<COLOR> : mark regexp's with this color
        full : Shows the full document if only a part is shown
        partial : Shows only a specific part of a document
        ? : this help
        q : quits more

          string|string * str
          The filename or the text which should be shown. It depends on the
          mode parameter how this argument is interpreted. If str is an array
          of strings the mode paramter is automatically set to MORE_STRING==2

          Mode flags are:
          0: default
          1 : do not write 'looks at a complete different reality'

          int itrans

          The object in which the above function will be called. Default is
          this_object()

        varargs int More (mixed fname, int chunk)

          string fname
          The filename which should be shown. 
          int chunk

          string fun
          After the text was mored the function fun in object ob is called
          by call_other(ob, fun). Setting a function will force the flag
          MORE_PROMPTLAST=16 to be set, i.e. wait after the last page for
          the more prompt
          object ob
