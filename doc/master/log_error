SYNOPSIS
        void log_error(string file, string err, int warn, int line)

DESCRIPTION
        Announce a compiler-time error (warn == 0) or warning (warn != 0)
        in the named file at the given line number.

        Whenever the LPC compiler detects an error or issues a warning,
        this function is called. It should at least log the error in a file,
        and also announce it to the active user.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.8 added the 'warn' argument and the warnings in general.
        LDMud 3.6.5 added the 'line' argument.
