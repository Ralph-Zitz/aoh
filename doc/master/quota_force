SYNOPSIS
        Quota for police force

DESCRIPTION
        This should be a certain number of people a cop 
        catches breaking the law, its a goal in a sense.
        Its sorta ridiculous though, I mean, what if
        they overdo it and get over zealous about it?
        Anyways, I think the only real quota they
        usually adhere to strongly is the one where with
        eating a predetermined amount of donuts.
