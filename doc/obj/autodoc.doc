SYNOPSIS:        
        xclone /obj/tool/autodoc
        Usage: doc <filename>
        
        (filename with or without extension)
        

DESCRIPTION:        
        The autodoc tool is made for you to generate documentations of
        your files automatically. The autodoc tool can detect special
        comments if you follow the guildelines for the comments in your
        file. The output is written into the same directory as the source
        file but with the extension .doc (without any warning if there is
        already such a file !!). But this technic will prevent you from
        overwriting an old doc-file (they are mostly moved to the doc
        directories). You have to move the doc-file manually to the right
        doc-directory (after checking the doc-file of course).
        
        The special comments start with a @ followed (without any space)
        by one of the next strings: (can be placed everywhere in the file)
        
        @synopsis - all following text until end of comment is added to
        the synopsis
        
        @description - all following text until end of comment is added to
        the description
        
        @author - the following word is added to the list of authors
        
        @version - the following string (until linefeed) is used as
        versionstring
        
        @todo - all following text until end of comment is used as TODO text
        
        @bugs - all following text until end of comment describes know bugs
        
        @example - all text until next linefeed describes example files
        (points to example files)
        
        @see - links to other files (but not to examples)
        
        
        For each public function use the following special comments:
        (only functions which are preceeded by a @function comment appears
        in the auto-documentation)
        
        @function - starts a function definition for the following function
        
        @return - declares the return value of the function
        
        @param - defines the parameters of the function
        

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS


        private void search_function(string comment,int pos,string file) 
        search_function
        
        Parameter:
          string comment - a string of a special comment
          int pos - position of comment in whole file
          string file - a string contains the whole file
          
        Return Value:
          none

        private void search_author(string comment) 
        just another demonstration how the function extraction will work
        the description of the comment can be longer than one line!
        
        Parameter:
          string comment - the actual special comment string
          and this one too?
          
        Return Value:
          none

        private void search_version(string comment) 
        and a 3rd function for checking
        with more than 1 line too
        and a 3rd line for func description
        
        Parameter:
          string comment - special doc comment
          
        Return Value:
          none
TODO
        solve the problem of long comments
        

KNOWN BUGS
        small problems with resolve_file
        problems with C++ comments (the double slash ones) if used in strings,
        not as comment!
        know problems with long strings in any special comment - 8 spaces will
        be preceeded and the output string will become too long
        

INHERITANCE
        autodoc
        |-obj/lib/string
        |-std/thing

EXAMPLES
        There is actually no example file available
        but you may try 'doc autodoc' to autodoc itself
