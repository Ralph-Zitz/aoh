SYNOPSIS
	#include <money.h>
	[...]
	BANKOBJECT-><function>

DESCRIPTION
	The Bankobject handles the accounts of the players.
	It offers various functions, which are:
	(CU = Currency Unit (== copper coins))
	
	void LoadAccounts(void|int force)
	  Load the account-database. It won't be loaded, if the
	  accounts are already created. To do this, you have to set
	  the force-flag to non-zero.
	void SaveAccounts()
	  Saves the account-database

	int HasAccount(string player)
	  Returns a non-zero value, if the player has an account.

	mapping QueryAccounts()
	  Returns the account-mapping. The following entries can be
	  found in there (defines from money.h):
	    A_AMOUNT	the CU (Currency Unit) amount on
			the player's account
	    A_CREATED	when the account has been created
	    A_DEPOSIT	the last time something got deposit by the
			player
	    A_WITHDRAW	the last time the player withdrawed something
			from her/his account

	int SetAccount(string player,int amount)
	  Sets the amount of CU on the players account. If the
	  account doesn't exist, it will be created. If the player
	  doesn't exist, it won't be created.
	  SetAccount returns a non-zero value, if the setting was
	  successful.

	int AddAccount(string player,int amount)
	  Same as SetAccount, but the amount will be added to the
	  amount on the account. If the resulting value on the account
	  is less than zero, AddAccount will return 0 else, if all
	  other checks from have been passed successfully and the
	  amount on the account got changed, it will return 1.

	int QueryAccount(string player)
	  This function returns -1, if the player has no account else
	  it will return the amount of CU on the players account.

	mapping QueryFullAccount(string player)
	  Returns all data about an account of the player. The result
	  may be evaluated just like the result of QueryAccounts.
	  E. g. QueryFullAccount("wessex") might return:
	    (["wessex":1000;786657700;786657792;786657795])
	  i. e.:
	    Wessex has 1000 CU on his account (A_AMOUNT),
	    his account was created on Mon Dex  5 21:01:40 1994 (A_CREATED),
	    he last deposited on Mon Dec  5 21:03:12 1994 (A_DEPOSIT) and
	    he last withdrawed on Mon Dec  5 21:03:15 1994 (A_WITHDRAW).

	int CloseAccount(string player)
	  This closes the account of the player (removes it from the
	  database). On success 1 is returned else 0.

	On every reset the bankobject will check a certain amount of
	accounts, if they should still exist. They will be deleted
	when either the owner doesn't exist in the mud or the owner
	is a Learner/Wizard.
