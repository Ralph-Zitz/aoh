SYNOPSIS
	#include <properties.h>
	#include <equipment.h>

	inherit "/obj/equipment";
	  or
	clone_object("/obj/equipment");


DESCRIPTION
	This is a simple generic equipment thing, combined from
	/std/thing and /std/equipment.
	By default, it can be just worn.

	Following functions have been redefined to entange the
	/std/thing with the /std/equipment:

	  void init ()
	  int move (mixed dest, int method, mixed extra)
	  int remove()
	  int QueryValue(int sc)
	  string Long(string what)
	  string InvShort (string what)

	If QueryValue() is passed a non-zero argument, the unmodified
	value originally set is returned, else the value modified
	according to the objects quality.
