	/obj/timetable - a generic time-table for the /room/port.c

AUTHOR

DESCRIPTION
	The timetable.c was built to create automatically a central time-table
	for a harbour consisting of several quays.
	It asks the different quays for their own local time-tables and
	creates a larger one from.
	For configuration there are some functions:

	SetHarbour(string str)
	  Gives the harbour a name (e.g. "harbour of Dover")

	SetPath(string path)
	  Sets the default path where to search for the quay files.
	  Default is the path of the room, where the table is standing in.

	SetQuayId(string expr)
	  Gives a wildcarded expression to restrict the search to the specified
	  files. The wildcards follow the rules for the filesystem
	  (e.g. "harbour?", "quay*x").

	If the files are spread over several directories, this mechanism won't
	work. Therefore you may add the files manually.

	AddQuay(string file)
	  Adds a single quay file to the list.
