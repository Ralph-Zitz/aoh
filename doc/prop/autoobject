SYNOPSIS
    mixed P_AUTOOBJECT  "AutoObject"

    mixed Set(P_AUTOOBJECT, mixed value)
    mixed Query(P_AUTOOBJECT)

DESCRIPTION
    If a thing should be autoloading, this property has to be set to
    a non-zero value. Then value itself is stored in the player savefile
    at logout and restored in the objects P_AUTOOBJECT again when it
    the object is recreated on login.

    Objects with P_AUTOOBJECT set are not dropped when the player logs
    out, rather they are destructed.

    Autoloading objects should be _rare_ to keep their non-ordinary
    status. Traditionally they have neither value nor weight.

EXAMPLE
    ob->Set(P_AUTOOBJECT, 1)  // makes ob autoloading, whatever ob is.
