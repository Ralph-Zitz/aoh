SYNOPSIS
    int P_BRIGHT  "Bright"

    int Set(P_BRIGHT, int value)
    int Query(P_BRIGHT)
      or
    int SetBright(int value)
    int QueryBright()

DESCRIPTION
    The amount of light the object emits on its own. It radiates both
    outwards and inwards.

    Default value is 0 for things, resp. 75% of MAX_SUNBRIGHT for rooms.

    The brightness of the midday sun is defined in <config.h>
    as MAX_SUNBRIGHT, darkness are all values <= 0.
    The various brightnesses of the daytimes are defined in <nightday.h>.

    For rooms, any change to P_BRIGHT, P_INDOORS, P_OUTDOORS, or P_INT_LIGHT
    disables the default lighting.

EXAMPLE
    -- Emit some light. Using an absolute value looks easy, but makes
       the object code quite vulnerable.
    Set(P_BRIGHT, 10);

    -- Emit as much light as 1/10th of the sun, but at least 1.
    Set(P_BRIGHT, (MAX_SUNBRIGHT/10) || 1);

    -- Emit as much light as the sun at dawn.
    Set(P_BRIGHT, ND_REL_STATE(ND_DAWN, MAX_SUNBRIGHT));

AVAILABILITY
    Include: <properties.h>
             <config.h>  : MAX_SUNBRIGHT
             <nightday.h>: ND_REL_STATE() and the ND_states
