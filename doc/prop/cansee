SYNOPSIS
    int P_CANSEE  "CanSee"

    int Set(P_CANSEE, int value)
    int Query(P_CANSEE)

DESCRIPTION
    This property determines if a living can see in a room even if
    the actual lighting would prohibit.
    The default value 0 turns this feature off (the normal light limits
    apply), a non-zero value turns it on.

    The actual evaluation is done in the lfun
    /std/room/restrictions::CanSeeHere():
	    
      int CanSeeHere(void|object living)
        Check if <living> can see even if the lighting is too dark
        or too bright. Result is 1 if the living can always see,
	and 0 if the normal light limits apply.
	The default behaviour is to check the P_CANSEE property.

    This lfun is called as part of the normal living::CanSee/CantSee()
    processing.
    

EXAMPLE
    // Make this room decent for players of every race
    Set(P_CANSEE, 1);
