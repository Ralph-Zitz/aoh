SYNOPSIS
    int P_CLONED  "Cloned"  --  read only

    int Query(P_CLONED)
      or
    int QueryCloned()

DESCRIPTION
    Set to a negative number in a blueprint if clones have been made
    from this blueprint. It is also set to a positive number 
    for cloned objects themselves.
    Beware: there may be objects for which this doesn't hold!

    The property is internally used to control the automatic
    replace_program() of rooms, and may also be used for debugging
    purposes in really weird cases.

EXAMPLE
    if (obj->Query(P_CLONED))
      write(to_string(obj)+" has been cloned.\n");
