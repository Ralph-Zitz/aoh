SYNOPSIS
    string P_CREATOR  "Creator"  -- read only

    string Query(P_CREATOR)
      or
    string QueryCreator()

DESCRIPTION
    The object_name() of that object which loaded/cloned this object.

    This property is useful mostly for debugging purposes.
    If a player complains about a buggy item (or monster or ...),
    the P_CREATOR of that item will be the room which created the
    item.
    Or in cases of illegal wizard helping, the P_CREATOR might be the
    offending wizard 'object'.

EXAMPLE
    obj->Query(P_CREATOR) -> "/d/beyond/rooms/cart/red"
      -- The offending object obj was created by the named room in
         the Beyond domain.
