SYNOPSIS
    int P_DECAY  "Decay"

    int Set(P_DECAY, int value)
    int Query(P_DECAY)
      or
    int SetDecay(int value)
    int QueryDecay()

DESCRIPTION
    An increasing counter denoting the state of decay of this corpse.
    0 denotes a fresh corpse, positive values a somewhat rotten one.
    Setting this to a negative value creates a non-decaying corpse.

    Unsually there is no need to set this property, as the mudlib
    handles it well enough.

EXAMPLE
    if (obj->Query(P_DECAY))
      write("It's somewhat rotten.\n");
