SYNOPSIS
    int P_EDITING "Editing"

    int Set(P_EDITING, int value)
    int Query(P_EDITING)
      or
    int SetEditing(int value)
    int QueryEditing()

DESCRIPTION
    A Query to this property returns 1 if the user currently is inside ed,
    an input_to or a custom editor (see below). The Query checks the prop
    itself, query_editing() and query_input_pending().

    This property has to be Set when the user is inside a custom edit which 
    does _NOT_ use input_to() or ed(). If you do not Set it then no message
    buffering will take place.

EXAMPLE
    Query( P_EDITING );
    Set( P_EDITING, 1 );
