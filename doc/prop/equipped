SYNOPSIS
    object P_EQUIPPED  "Equipped"

    object Set(P_EQUIPPED, object user)
    object Query(P_EQUIPPED)

DESCRIPTION
    If an object is considered as 'equipment' by a user, the user object
    is stored in this property.

    As effect, an equipment object carried by its user no longer reacts on
    'all' commands like 'drop all' - instead the enforced variant 'really
    all' has to be used. This is like wielded weapons and worn armours
    are handled, just that P_EQUIPPED is meant for non-combative equipment.

    Usually, the player appoints an object as 'equipment' via use of the
    'equip' command.
