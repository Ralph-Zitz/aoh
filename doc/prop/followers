SYNOPSIS
    object * P_FOLLOWERS  "Followers"

    object * Set(P_FOLLOWERS, object * value)
    object Query(P_FOLLOWERS)
      or
    object SetFollowers(object * value)
    object QueryFollowers()

      Maintained through:
    object * AddFollower(object f)
    object * RemoveFollower(object f)

DESCRIPTION
    This property holds an array of objects which are to follow this object
    on every movment. On default, it is empty.

    Whenever the object moves, the lfun

      follow (string|object dest, int method, mixed data)

    is called in each of the followers. <data>, <method> and <data> are
    the arguments originally passed to this object's move() lfun.
    Default behaviour of follow() is that the called object moves to
    <dest> using <method> and <data>, unless it's P_NOFOLLOW property
    is set.

    If objects are following an interactive player, they are informed about
    the netdeath status of the player by calls to their lfun
      void PlayerNetdead(int isdead).

    Never set P_FOLLOWERS directly, instead use AddFollower() and
    RemoveFollower() to modify the property.

    Objects which are set as followers, either by Set() or by AddFollower(),
    get their P_IS_FOLLOWER property set. However, that property can't be
    reset automatically.
    
EXAMPLE
    find_player("mateese")->AddFollower(this_player());
      -- Let's the current player follow the player Mateese.
