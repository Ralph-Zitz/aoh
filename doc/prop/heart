SYNOPSIS
    int P_HEART  "Heart"

    int SetHeart(int value)
    int QueryHeart()

DESCRIPTION
    Property controlling the heart of a living. Set to true, the
    heart_beat() will be called. Set to false, heart_beat() will not
    be called unless there are heart_beat hooks active in parallel.

    The property can't be set to true if there is no heart_beat()
    function outside of /std/living/heart.
    
EXAMPLE
    SetHeart(1);  // Activate the default heartbeat

    heart_beat()  // Typical heart_beat() function
    {
      ::heart_beat();
      if (QueryHeart()) {
        ...your code here...
      }
    }
