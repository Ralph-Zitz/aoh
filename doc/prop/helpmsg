SYNOPSIS
    string|closure P_HELP_MSG  "HelpMsg"

    string|closure Set(P_HELP_MSG, string|closure value)
    string|closure Query(P_HELP_MSG)
      or
    string|closure SetHelpMsg(string|closure value)
    string|closure QueryHelpMsg()

DESCRIPTION
    You should put a short informational text about the object/room in here.
    It should explain the object and its commands.
    The text is queried by the player 'help' command.
    
    Instead of a string a closure can also be used as value.
    Upon query, the closure is executed and has to return the informational
    text as result.

    If a player ask for help on an object with not P_HELP_MSG
    set, a BUG report is generated. This can be avoided by
    setting the P_HELP_MSG to the empty string (default for rooms).
    In this case, the player will see a default text.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_HELP_MSG, "The torch provides lights when lit.");
    Set(P_HELP_MSG, #'ExplainThisObject);

AVAILABILITY
    Include: <properties.h>
