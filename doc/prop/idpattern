SYNOPSIS
    string * P_ID_PATTERN  "IdPattern"

    string * Set(P_ID_PATTERN, string value)
    string * Query(P_ID_PATTERN)
      or
    string SetIdPattern(string value)
    string QueryIdPattern()

DESCRIPTION
    The property holds the regular-expression pattern used by /std/thing::id()
    to recognize textual references to the object. The property is set
    by the id() function itself whenever its current value is 0. Since
    every change to the object's ids, adjectives, class-ids and class-adjectives
    resets P_ID_PATTERN back to 0, the pattern is guaranteed to be up
    to date.

    The actual generation is done with the sefun gen_id_pattern(). The
    property is provided for debugging purposes only. It can be set to
    any value, but should be set to 0 only if at all.

EXAMPLE
    QueryIdPattern()  -- returns the current id regexp pattern.
    SetIdPattern(0)   -- resets the id pattern, it will be recreated with
                         the next call to id().
