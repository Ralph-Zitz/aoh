SYNOPSIS
    int P_INDOORS  "Indoors"

    int Set(P_INDOORS, int value)
    int Query(P_INDOORS)
      or
    int SetIndoors(int value)
    int QueryIndoors()

DESCRIPTION
    If the value is zero, the room is an outdoors room and thus influenced
    by light (and in several domains also by weather).
    If the value is non-zero, it is an indoors room.

    Default value is 1.

    Any modification of this property (or of P_OUTDOORS, P_INT_LIGHT or
    P_BRIGHT) will end the automatic lighting of the room.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_INDOORS, 0);  -- Mark this room as outdoors room.
