SYNOPSIS
    int P_INHERITED  "Inherited"  --  read only

    int Query(P_INHERITED)
      or
    int QueryInherited()

DESCRIPTION
    The value of this property is non-zero, if the object was loaded
    indirectly by being inherited by some other object. It is zero if
    the object was explicitely loaded.
    The value is indeterminate if an object is first explicitely loaded
    and then also used for inheritance.

    The property is useful for debugging purposes in really weird cases.

EXAMPLE
    if (obj->Query(P_INHERITED))
      write(to_string(obj)+" has been loaded by inheritance.\n");
