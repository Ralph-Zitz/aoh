SYNOPSIS
    int P_INT_LIGHT  "IntLight"

    int Set(P_INT_LIGHT, int value)
    int Query(P_INT_LIGHT)
      or
    int SetIntLight(int value [, int nosun ] )
    int QueryIntLight( [ int nosun ] )

DESCRIPTION
    The property returns the amount of light inside of the room. It includes
    the light radiated by the room itself (P_BRIGHT), by contained objects and
    any sunlight.
    Setting the property modifies the P_BRIGHT property to achieve the wanted
    lighting.
    If the parameter <nosun> is non-zero on the direct function calls, the
    actual sunlight is left out of the computations.

    Any modification to P_INT_LIGHT, P_BRIGHT, P_INDOORS or P_OUTDOORS will
    disable the automatic lighting of rooms.

EXAMPLE
    write("The light level is "+Query(P_INT_LIGHT)*".\n");

                      SetIntLight(l, 1)
    is equivalent to: Set(P_INT_LIGHT, l-QuerySunLight()).
