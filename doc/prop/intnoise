SYNOPSIS
    string P_INT_NOISE  "IntNoise"

    string Set(P_INT_NOISE, string value)
    string Query(P_INT_NOISE)
      or
    string SetIntNoise(string value)
    string QueryIntNoise()

      Queried via:
    string Noise (void|string what)
    string IntNoise (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The internal noise description of the room, which is perceived by the
    player with the "listen" command.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfuns
    (Int)Noise() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is
    through the use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfuns is 0 in case of a general command
    ("look"), or "<thing>" in case of a "look <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    IntNoise() simply returns the (possibly modified) P_INT_NOISE and is used
      for everything.

    Noise() returns the IntNoise() or, if <what> is given, the description
    of detail <what>.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_INT_NOISE, "You hear condensed water dripping from the ceiling.\n");
