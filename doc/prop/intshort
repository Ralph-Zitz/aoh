SYNOPSIS
    string P_INT_SHORT  "IntShort"

    string Set(P_INT_SHORT, string value)
    string Query(P_INT_SHORT)
      or
    string SetIntShort(string value)
    string QueryIntShort()

      Queried via:
    string Short (void|string what)
    string IntShort (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The internal short description of the room which must be a single lined
    string _not_ ending in a newline. It should "name" the room.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfuns
    (Int)Short() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is
    through the use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfuns is 0 in case of a general command
    ("look"), or "<thing>" in case of a "look <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    IntShort() simply returns the (possibly modified) P_INT_SHORT and is used
      for everything.

    Short() returns the IntShort() or, if <what> is given, the description
    of detail <what>.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_INT_SHORT, "Hall of the Mountain King");
