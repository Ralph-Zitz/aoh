SYNOPSIS
    string P_INT_SMELL  "IntSmell"

    string Set(P_INT_SMELL, string value)
    string Query(P_INT_SMELL)
      or
    string SetIntSmell(string value)
    string QueryIntSmell()

      Queried via:
    string Smell (void|string what)
    string IntSmell (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The internal smell description of the room, which is perceived by the
    player with the "smell" command.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfuns
    (Int)Smell() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is
    through the use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfuns is 0 in case of a general command
    ("look"), or "<thing>" in case of a "look <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    IntSmell() simply returns the (possibly modified) P_INT_SMELL and is used
      for everything.

    Smell() returns the IntSmell() or, if <what> is given, the description
    of detail <what>.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_INT_SMELL, "You smell the dampness of centuries.\n");
