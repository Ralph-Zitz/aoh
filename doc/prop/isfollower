SYNOPSIS
    mixed P_IS_FOLLOWER  "IsFollower"

    mixed Set(P_IS_FOLLOWER, mixed value)
    mixed Query(P_IS_FOLLOWER)

DESCRIPTION
    This property describes if the object is following some other object,
    like familiars do.
    It has a non-zero value if the object is a follower, and zero else.
    
    The property does not reflect if the object is in following mode
    at the very moment, and it should be set explicitely by the wizard
    in the object's create().

    Setting P_FOLLOWERS or adding a follower does set P_IS_FOLLOWER in
    the set object(s). However, it is not possible to reset the property
    as automatically.

EXAMPLE
    // In a familiars create...
    void create() {
      ...
      Set(P_IS_FOLLOWER, 1);
      ...
    }
