SYNOPSIS
    int P_IS_VIRTUAL  "IsVirtual"  --  read only

    int Query(P_IS_VIRTUAL)
      or
    int QueryIsVirtual()

DESCRIPTION
    The value of this property is non-zero if the object is a 'virtual
    object'. These are objects for which no separate source file exists
    (though object_name() claims otherwise) and thus need a special
    master object to be recreated.

EXAMPLE
    if (obj->Query(P_IS_VIRTUAL))
      write("Object is virtual.\n");
