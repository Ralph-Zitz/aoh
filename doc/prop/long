SYNOPSIS
    string (*) P_LONG  "Long"

    string (*) Set(P_LONG, string(*) value)
    string (*) Query(P_LONG)
      or
    string (*) SetLong(string(*) value)
    string (*) QueryLong()

      Queried via:
    string Long (void|string what)
    string ExaLong (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The long description of the thing, which is shown when looking at or
    examining the object. It does not contain data describing exits or
    contents.
    When set to just a simple string, it wil be used for both "look" and
    "examine" commands. In the latter case, "You see nothing special." will
    be prepended.
    When set to an array of two strings, the first serves the "look" command,
    the second the "examine" command.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfuns
    Long() and ExaLong() to allow for temporary changes without touching
    the property itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is
    through the use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfuns is 0 in case of a general command
    ("look"), or "<thing>" in case of a "look <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    Note that Long() and ExaLong() also serve requests for the description
    of details on this object, see subdetails(P).

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_LONG, "An ordinary thing.\n");
    Set(P_LONG, ({ "An ordinary thing.\n"
                 , "Really, just an ordinary string.\n"})
       );
