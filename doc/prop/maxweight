SYNOPSIS
    int P_MAX_WEIGHT  "MaxWeight"

    int Set(P_MAX_WEIGHT, int value)
    int Query(P_MAX_WEIGHT)
      or
    int SetMaxWeight(int value)
    int QueryMaxWeight()

      Accessed via:
    int  MayAddWeight (int w)
    void AddIntWeight (int w)

DESCRIPTION
    The property holds the maximum weight of the room plus contents (note
    that a normal room has no own weight).
    It may be set any time, but to no lower than the current P_WEIGHT.

    Default value is 2**30 (about 1000 tons).

    This property is important for containers and inrooms.

    To check if a certain weight <w> may be added(/removed) to the room,
    call the lfun MayAddWeight(w). It returns non-zero if addition(/removal)
    is possible, else 0.
    The actual change is then done by a call to AddIntWeight(w).
    Both functions also take the MAX_WEIGHT of enclosing containers/rooms into
    account.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_MAX_WEIGHT, 300000);  -- sets the MAX_WEIGHT to 300kg.
