SYNOPSIS
    string P_NOISE  "Noise"

    string Set(P_NOISE, string value)
    string Query(P_NOISE)
      or
    string SetNoise(string value)
    string QueryNoise()

      Queried via:
    string Noise (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The noise description of the thing which is printed when the player
    listens to the thing.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfun
    Noise() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is through the
    use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfun is 0 in case of a general command
    ("listen"), or "<thing>" in case of a "listen <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_NOISE, "Ordinary things are silent by nature.\n");
