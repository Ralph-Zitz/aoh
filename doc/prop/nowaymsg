SYNOPSIS
    string P_NOWAY_MSG  "NowayMsg"

    string Set(P_NOWAY_MSG, string value)
    string Query(P_NOWAY_MSG)
      or
    string SetNowayMsg(string value)
    string QueryNowayMsg()

      /std/room expects also:
    string QueryNowayMsg(string verb, string arg)

DESCRIPTION
    This string is the message given to players which try to leave a
    room into a direction where no exit exists. Usually they are told
    "No way.\n", but using this property a different message may be
    set.

    To query the message for an actual movement, the second form of
    QueryNowayMsg() is used, allowing to modify the message according
    to <verb> and <arg>.
    If for <verb> a message is set in P_NOWAY_MSGS (note the
    additional 'S'), that message is returned, else the P_NOWAY_MSG
    itself.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_NOWAY_MSG, "You bump into a wall.\n");

AVAILABILITY
    Include: <properties.h>

    Availability: /std/room(/exits) and descendants.
