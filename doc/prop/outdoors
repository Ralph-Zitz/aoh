SYNOPSIS
    mixed P_OUTDOORS  "Outdoors"

    mixed Set(P_OUTDOORS, mixed value)
    mixed Query(P_OUTDOORS)
      or
    mixed SetOutdoors(mixed value)
    mixed QueryOutdoors()

DESCRIPTION
    This property serves as simple way to initialize P_INDOORS and P_SERVER
    at once.
    When queried, it returns for indoors rooms 0, or for outdoor rooms the
    filename of the weather server in charge.
    When set to 0, it just sets P_INDOORS to 0, marking this room as indoors.
    When set to a non-zero number, it sets P_INDOORS to this number, marking
    this room as outdoors with NIGHTDAY as weather server.
    When set to a string, it stores this string as server filename P_SERVER
    and sets P_INDOORS to non-zero to mark the room as outdoors.

    Default value is 0.

    Any modification of this property (or of P_INDOORS, P_INT_LIGHT or
    P_BRIGHT) will end the automatic lighting of the room.

EXAMPLE

    -- Variant A:
