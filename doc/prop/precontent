SYNOPSIS
    string P_PRECONTENT  "PreContent"

    string Set(P_PRECONTENT, string value)
    string Query(P_PRECONTENT)
      or
    string SetPreContent(string value)
    string QueryPreContent()

      Queried via:
    string Content (string what, mixed exclude, void|object player)

DESCRIPTION
    If set to a string, this string will be prepended the content list
    returned by GetIntDesc() and Content(). This is useful e.g. for tables.

    Default value is 0.

    The content of a room, including prefix P_PRECONTENT, are queried via
    the lfun Content().
    <what> is either 0 if the player issued a general perception command
      (like "look") or the argument given to the perception command.
    <exclude> determines the objects not to be listed in the inventory.
      If given at all, this_player() is always ignored. If it is a closure,
      it is called for each inventory object and has to return non-zero if
      the object is to be excluded.
    <player> denotes the living who queries the Content() and defaults
      to this_player().
    The result is a multilined string, but may "" or 0 for totally empty
    rooms.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_PRECONTENT, "On the table you see:\n");
