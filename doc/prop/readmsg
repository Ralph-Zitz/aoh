SYNOPSIS
    string P_READ_MSG  "ReadMsg"

    string Set(P_READ_MSG, string text)
    string Query(P_READ_MSG)
      or
    string SetReadMsg(P_READ_MSG, string text)
    string QueryReadMsg(P_READ_MSG)

      Queried via:
    string Read (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The text describing what the player sees when he "reads"  the
    thing.

    Instead of a string, the property may be set to a closure
    which is executed for each "read" command and has to return
    the actual read message.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfun
    Smell() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is through the
    use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfun is 0 in case of a general command
    ("smell"), or "<thing>" in case of a "smell <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    Note that Read() also serves the requests for details on this object,
    see subreadmsgs(P).

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_READ_MSG
       , "You read a short excerpt from the last Death-Gate book,\n");
