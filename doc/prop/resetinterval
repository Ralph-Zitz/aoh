SYNOPSIS
    int P_RESET_INTERVAL  "ResetInterval"  --  read only

    int Set(P_RESET_INTERVAL, int value)
    int Query(P_RESET_INTERVAL)

DESCRIPTION
    The time in seconds which has to elapse at least between two reset()s
    of the object. If set to 0 (the default), the gamedrivers builtin
    interval is used.

    The gamedriver imposes a granularity onto the reset intervals: each
    given interval is rounded up to the next time allowed by the granularity.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_RESET_INTERVAL, 3600);
      -- Requests a delay of at least one hour between two reset()s.

AVAILABILITY
