SYNOPSIS
    int P_SEE_INVIS  "SeeInvis"

    int Set(P_SEE_INVIS, int value)
    int Query(P_SEE_INVIS)

DESCRIPTION
    This property enables or disables a living to see invisible beings.
    If it is 0 (the default state), the living can't see invisibles, if it
    is non-zero, it can.
    
    Whether the living can see an invisible being on an actual look or not
    is further governed by the P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE property. That property
    gives the chance of an invisible-detection being successfull.
    However, if P_SEE_INVIS is zero, the P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE is of course
    ignored.

EXAMPLE
    /* In a monster's create: the monster can detect invisibles with 
     * a 50% success chance.
     */
    Set(P_SEE_INVIS, 1);
    Set(P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE, 500);
