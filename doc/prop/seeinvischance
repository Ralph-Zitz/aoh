SYNOPSIS
    int P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE  "SeeInvisChance"

    int Set(P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE, int value)
    int Query(P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE)

DESCRIPTION
    This property determines the chance that a living can detect an
    invisible being on a look. The value must be in the range 0..1000,
    with higher values meaning a higher success chance.
    The values 0 (the default) and 1000 mean 'succeeds all the time'.
    
    Note that the setting is ignored as long as P_SEE_INVIS is of value 0,
    thus switching the whole ability off.

EXAMPLE
    /* In a monster's create: the monster can detect invisibles with 
     * a 50% success chance.
     */
    Set(P_SEE_INVIS, 1);
    Set(P_SEE_INVIS_CHANCE, 500);
