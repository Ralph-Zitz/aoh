SYNOPSIS
    string P_SERVER  "Server"

DESCRIPTION
    The filename of the NightDay resp. weather server this room shall use
    if it is an outdoors room.

    Default value is NIGHTDAY (/obj/nighday).

    The weather server will call the lfun FilterWeatherData() for all those
    outdoor rooms, in which interactive players are or which have registered
    themselves with the server. The lfun will be called whenever the server
    changes the actual weather/daystate.

      mixed FilterWeatherData (object client, mixed *data, int newstate)

    For each <client>, the server will filter the weather <data> through
    all environments of <client>. <newstate> is the state the server will be
    in after completion of this weather change.
    The environment(s) may act on the <data> and return the (possibly modified)
    data array. Default is that the array is returned unchanged. The data finally
    existing will then be displayed to the <client>. If the lfun returns 0, nothing
    will be displayed (this is useful e.g. for rooms with windows which want
    emit a message if the weather/daystate outside changes).
    The actual content of <data> is up to the weather server.
