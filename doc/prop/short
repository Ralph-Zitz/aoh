SYNOPSIS
    string P_SHORT  "Short"

    string Set(P_SHORT, string value)
    string Query(P_SHORT)
      or
    string SetShort(string value)
    string QueryShort()

      Queried via:
    string Short (void|string what)
    string CapShort (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The short description of the thing which must be a single lined string,
    starting with a _lowercase_ letter and _not_ ending in a newline.
    If set to 0, the thing is invisible.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfuns
    Short() and CapShort() to allow for temporary changes without touching
    the property itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is
    through the use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfuns is 0 in case of a general command
    ("look"), or "<thing>" in case of a "look <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

    Short() simply returns the (possibly modified) P_SHORT and is used
      for everything but content listings.
    CapShort() returns the (possibly modified) P_SHORT capitalized, for
      invisible things (P_SHORT = 0) the empty string "" is returned.
      CapShort() is used for content listings.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_SHORT, "an ordinary thing");
