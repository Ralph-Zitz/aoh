SYNOPSIS
    int P_SIZE  "Size"

    int Set(P_SIZE, int value)
    int Query(P_SIZE)

DESCRIPTION
    This property gives a rough estimation of the relative size of a thing.
    Possible values are:
      PSIZE_GENERIC = 0: this object fits alls sizes
      PSIZE_SMALL   = 1: this object is a small one
      PSIZE_NORMAL  = 2: this object is of its typical size
      PSIZE_LARGE   = 3: this object is a large one

    To compare sizes, use this lfun:

      int CompareSize (int|object with)
        Compare the P_SIZE of the object with the given size
        <with>, resp. with the P_SIZE of the object <with>.
        Results are:
          < 0: this object is smaller than <with>
          = 0: this object is of same P_SIZE as <with>
          > 0: this object is larger than <with>

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_SIZE, PSIZE_SMALL);

    if (CompareSize(this_player()) < 0)
      write("This object is too small to handle for you.\n");
