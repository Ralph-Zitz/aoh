SYNOPSIS
    string P_SMELL  "Smell"

    string Set(P_SMELL, string value)
    string Query(P_SMELL)
      or
    string SetSmell(string value)
    string QuerySmell()

      Queried via:
    string Smell (void|string what)

DESCRIPTION
    The odor description of the thing which is printed when the player
    smells at the thing.

    The property is never queried directly, but always through the lfun
    Smell() to allow for temporary changes without touching the property
    itself. One way to establish such temporary changes is through the
    use of the P_EXTRA_DESC property.
    The <what> passed to the lfun is 0 in case of a general command
    ("smell"), or "<thing>" in case of a "smell <thing>" command. Do not
    rely too much on this, though.

EXAMPLE
    Set(P_SMELL, "It also smells ordinary.\n");
