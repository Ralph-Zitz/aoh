SYNOPSIS
    void dtell (string whom, string what)

DESCRIPTION
    Tells the string <what> to the player <whom>, if <whom> is logged
    on.
    This is an easy way to implement debug messages which won't break
    the game if one logs out.

EXAMPLE
    dtell("mateese", sprintf("%O: fun called\n", this_object()));

SEE ALSO
    tell_object(E)
