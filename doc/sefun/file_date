SYNOPSIS
        int file_date(string file)

DESCRIPTION
        Give the date of last modification of a file. The date is in time()
        format. You may want to give a human readable format with ctime(). -1
        indicates that the file either does not exist, or that it is not
        readable by you.

EXAMPLES
        write(ctime(file_date("/players/deepthought/.err"))+"\n");
        
        This will show you the date of Deepthought's last errors.
        
        write(ctime(file_date("/players/wizard"))+"\n");
        
        This will print the date of the last modified file of the wizard called
        "wizard".
