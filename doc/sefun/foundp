SYNOPSIS
    int foundp (object obj, mixed & data, void|int remove_it)

DESCRIPTION
    The given <obj> is searched in the <data> which has to be computed
    by a call to search(m)(). If the <obj> is contained, the function
    returns non-zero, else 0.

    If <remove_it> is non-zero, the <obj> is removed from <data> so
    that subsequent calls won't find it again. For this, <data> must
    be passed by reference.

EXAMPLE
    norm_id("the   yellow Car  ") --> "the yellow car"
