SYNOPSIS
    string gen_id_pattern (string * ids)
    string gen_id_pattern (string * ids, string * ads)

DESCRIPTION
    The list of id-string <ids>, and if given, the list of adjectives <ads>,
    define an object-id. In this id, every adjective may appear any
    number of times, in any order, but before the actual id-string. Exactly
    one id-string is allowed, which may be any of those given in <ids>.
    Any number of whitespace are allowed between and within any of these
    strings. All strings are interpreted as lower case.

    gen_id_pattern() takes the list of adjectives and id-strings and creates
    a regular-expression pattern suitable for matching the object-id.
    
    The function is usually used in conjunction with match_id().
