SYNOPSIS
	object load_object (string name)
	object load_object (string name, string creator)

DESCRIPTION
	Load the object <name>, whereas <name> is the object's filename
	(withough trailing ".c").
	Result is the loaded object.
	
	If <creator> is given and there is no sourcefile corresponding to
	<name>, the function calls <creator>->compile_object(<name>)
	in the assumption, that <name> was/is a virtual object, created
	by <creator>.
	
	<creator> must be the 'virtual master' for the object to load.
	It can be determined for a given object by querying its P_CREATOR
	property, i.e. object->Query(P_CREATOR).
	This is useful if the task is not to load an object first hand,
	but to reload a given object later.

	object_name(E), creator(prop), is_virtual(prop)
