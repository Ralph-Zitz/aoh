SYNOPSIS
        void ls(string path)

DESCRIPTION
        This function does exactly the same what the ls command does. It lists
        the contents of a directory which is specified by the argument path.
        Don't use this function at all. If you need the content of a dir use the
        efun get_dir() or get_dir_ext() instead.

SEE ALSO
        get_dir(E), get_dir_ext(E)
