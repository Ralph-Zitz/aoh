SYNOPSIS
        #include <msgclass.h>

	void msg_say( int class, mixed msg )
	void msg_say( int class, mixed msg, object exclude )
	void msg_say( int class, mixed msg, object *excludes )

DESCRIPTION
	The message will be sent to all livings in the environment of
        the current user when the call of msg_say() is the cause of a user
        action. Else the message will go to all livings in the environment
        of the calling object. For example when called from a heart_beat(),
        or via call_out().

        Object(s) given as excludes do not receive the message.

        This function is the equivalent to the efun say() for the message
        system.

EXAMPLES
	msg_say( CMSG_SAY, "Hi!\n" );
	msg_say( CMSG_SAY, "Hi!\n", this_player() );

	Both calls are equal when called by a not living object.
