SYNOPSIS
	int ord(string str)

DESCRIPTION
        Return the ordinal (ascii) value of the first character of <str>.
        <str> must not contain more than one character.

        Note that indexing the string does the same; ord() is merely provided
        to complement chr().

EXAMPLES
        ord("0") -> 48
        "0"[0]   -> 48

        chr(ord("0")) -> "0"

SEE ALSO
	chr(SEFUN)
