SYNOPSIS
	object present_clone(string|object str [, int deep ] )
	object present_clone(string|object str, object ob [, int deep] )

DESCRIPTION
	This functions searches the inventory of <ob> (or
	this_object() if <ob> is not given) for a clone of object <str>.
	<str> may be the filename of the blueprint, the filename of
	a clone or the blueprint/clone itself.

	If <deep> is given with a non-zero value, the object is
	searched in the complete, nested, inventory, else just in the
	topmost inventory.

	Result is either the object searched for, or 0 if no such
	object is contained.

EXAMPLE
	// Test if this_player() carries a clone of /obj/torch
	if (present_clone("/obj/torch", this_player()))
          ...do something...

	// Test if this_player() carries a clone of some object <obj>
	// somewhere (this is a deep search!)
	if (present_clone(obj, this_player(), 1))
	  ... do something...
