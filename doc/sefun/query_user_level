SYNOPSIS
        int query_user_level (object player)
        int query_user_level (string player)

DESCRIPTION
        Return the user level code of the player. The argument player can be
	the name of the player or his object file.

	The userlevels are defined in /sys/secure/wizlevels.h as
	  LVL_PLAYER  == 0 : normal players
	  LVL_ANCIENT == 1 : retired players (do have some wizard features)
	  LVL_WIZARD  == 2 : wizards

	/sys/secure/wizlevels.h defines several macros to check the level
	of an object or player in a more comprehensible way:

	  IS_PLAYER(x)   : returns true if x is a player or an immortal in
	                   player mode.
	  IS_IMMORTAL(x) : returns true if x is immortal, i.e. elder or
	                   wizard.
	  IS_ANCIENT(x)  : returns true if x is an elder.
	  IS_WIZARD(x)   : returns true if x is a wizard.

	  IS_HLP(x)      : returns true if x is a high-level player.

	It is recommended to use the macros instead of direct level
	comparisons.
