NAME
	sefun

DESCRIPTION
	This directory contains descriptions for the simulated efuns of
	OSB.

	Simulated efuns are similar to efuns in that they can be called by
	any LPC object. In contrast to 'true' efuns, they are not implemented
	by the parser but instead by a special LPC object (the simul_efun
	object).
