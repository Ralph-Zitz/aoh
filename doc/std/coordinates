this file is only some preliminary text about how to use
coordinates. Basically it does nothing else as to describe
the functions at the moment.

to make the property work, i changed the syntax too.

QueryCoordinates()
   this returns either 0 (if no coordinates are set,
   or the array ({x,y,z}) with the actual coordinates

SetCoordinates( ({ x,y,z }) );
 this sets some fixed coordinates

SetCoordinates( ({ ({ x,y,z }) }) );
 this does the same.

SetCoordinates( ({ ({ x,y,z }), ({ x,y,z }) }) );
 this sets the first set of coordinates relative to the
 second set. for example, if you include /sys/coordinates.h
 to your file, you can use SetCoordinates( ({ ({10,10,0}),C_SILVERE }) );
 to set the room-coordinates relative to the throneroom of Silvere.

If you have any questions about that, just ask me
