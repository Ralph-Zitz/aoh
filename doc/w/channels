COMMAND
	channels

DESCRIPTION
	Channels are an additional means to communicate besides say
	and tells. They are as powerful as shouts, but less annoying.
	Everything is said on a channel can be heard by anyone
	listening to it. Each channel has it's own topic, and may be
	turned off on individual basis by those who aren't interested.

	Channels are divided into player channels and wizard channels.
	Players can just use the player channels, wizards every
	channel. 

	The command 'channels' shows all available channels and their
	status (on or off).

	The important player channels are:

	  player channel
	    The general channel for players, everything related to the
	    game.

	  chat channel
	    A channel for miscellaneous chats.

	  help channel
	    Here players can ask for help.

	The important wizard channels:

	  general channel
	    This is the main channel for wizards. It should be used as a
	    shout to all wizards.

	  lpc channel
	    This channel should be used if you got a problem in lpc or if you
	    can answer such a problem.

	  error channel
	    On this channel errors will be reported which normally don't
	    reported through the gamedriver. For example whenever a player
	    traps into a "your sensitive mind ..." error the real error
	    message will be send on the error channel.
