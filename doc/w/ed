SYNOPSIS
    ed
    ed <file>
    ed <object>

DESCRIPTION
  Edit the file <file>, which is searched in the current directory.
  For instructions how to use 'ed', look at /doc/intro/ed.
  If started with no argument, the editor will start with the last
  file containing an error (run-time or compiler error). So,when you
  log in to the game, start with 'ed' to see if you have had any
  errors.

  If given an <object> the command searches the object and start the
  editor in its source file.

  You can leave 'ed' with the command 'q', or 'Q' if the file has been
  modified.
  When in 'ed', the prompr will change to ':'.

  The file will be searched for in the current directory. 'ed castle.c' will
  edit the castle of the wizard.

EXAMPLES
  ed here        --> edit the source code of your current room.
  ed castle.c    --> edit 'castle.c' in your current directory.
  ed ~/castle.c  --> edit 'castle.c' in your home directory.
