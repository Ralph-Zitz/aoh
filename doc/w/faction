faction [stop]

W/o argument, faction displays if an asynchronous operation is active, and
tries to guess which one.

With arg 'stop', any asynchronous action is stopped.

The reason for the asynchronous actions is, that some actions have to do
more computations than the gamedriver allows, so the complete action is
broken into several parts and these are executed in a chain of call_outs.
