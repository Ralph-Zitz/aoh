Concept: File-aliases

File-aliases are a method for abbreviating filenames. So you could give
e.g. "efundoc" instead of "/doc/efun".

Expansion works by dividing a given filename at the "/", then
replacing each part by its expansion IF the namepart happens to be a
defined alias, and finally remerging the processed name.
This processing is not recursive.

Example:
  'beyond' set to '/d/beyond/', 'lpc' set to 'common/lpc'.
  The name 'beyond/lpc/exm' would now expand to '/d/beyond//common/lpc/exm'.
   
Note that this expansion is pure text replacement. It's up to you to
define your aliases in a sensible way. It might be a good idea to add an
unusual special character (':', '_', '$', etc.) to your alias to make the
difference to a normal name clear.
The alias may not contain "/"s and spaces, the expansion may not 
contain spaces.

File-aliases are recognized by following commands:

  load, clone, Update, update, Destruct, destruct,
  cp, mv, join, rm, ls, lls, chk, more, type, cat, tail, cd, 
  mkdir, rmdir, ed
