SYNOPSIS
  goto           <target>
  goto liv[ing]  <name>
  goto pl[ayer]  <name>
  goto obj[ect]  <spec>|<filename>
  goto room      <spec>|<filename>
  goto target    <spec>

DESCRIPTION
  Teleport into a room or to an player. Using the keywords 'living',
  'player', 'object' and 'room' (and their synonymes) the target may
  specified more exactly. If none of the keywords is given, all
  variants are tried in this order until a target is found.

  goto living|player <name> goes into the room where the named
    living/player is.
  goto object <spec>|<filename> goes into the room where the named
    object is.
  goto room <spec>|<filename> goes into the named room. If the room
    is not loaded and it's file exists, the command tries to load it
    first.
  goto target <spec> goes into the named target.

  <spec> is an object specification like in the get/drop commands.
  <filename> is the object_name() of the object (the file itself needn't
    exist). Trailing ".c"s are ignored, filealiases applied.

EXAMPLES
  goto mateese
  goto obj /d/beyond/npc/hurxel#3456
  goto room /d/beyond/rooms/silvere/center/harbour/entrance
  goto mouse in wardrobe
  goto target pub
