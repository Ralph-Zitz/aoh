join <source> <destination>

Appends a file <source> to a file <destination> (default is the current 
directory). If <destination> doesn't exist, it is created. 

If <destination> is a directory, the correct basename is automatically 
added, e.g. 'cp foo.c /players/jrwiz' would append the file foo.c to 
the file /players/jrwiz/foo.c .

<source> may be wildcarded, then the work is done asynchronously.

Of course you must have the right to write into the destination
directory.
