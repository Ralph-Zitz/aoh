lls [<path>]

Give a list of all files in <path>. If no argument is given, list the
files in current directory.

'lls /' will give a list of all files in the game home directory.

In contrast to ls this command gives more information about the files.

Some filenames will have an extra character at their end. 
The meanings are:

  <name>  : an ordinary file.
  <name>/ : this is a directory.

See also: w/ls, w/chk, w/cat, w/ed, w/rm, w/wildcards.
