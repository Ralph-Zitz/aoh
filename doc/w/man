SYNOPSIS:        
        man <topic>
        man <section> <topic>
        man <section> list
        man <section> <regexp> list
        man <section> init
        man <filename> new
        

DESCRIPTION:        
        'man <topic>' displays the doc file to the given topic or keyword.
        'man <section> <topic>' shows only the topics of the given section
        'man <section> <regexp> list' lists the contents of the assiociated
        section which contain the given regexp.
        'man <section> list' lists the contents of the assiociated section
        'man <section> init' reinmitialises the given section. This is needed
        if you create a NEW manfile in this section.
        'man <filename> new' will reindex or index the given file, this adding
        its keywords and alias to the database.
        The command given without any argument lists the available topic
        groups.
        
        The argument is treated without regard to casing or special
        characters, i.e. 'man P_LONG' and 'man plong' are identical.
        If for one topic several different doc files exist, the command
        displays a menu with the possible choices. The user may now select
        one of the choices by entering its number or the pathname displayed.
        Entering 'q' or 'quit' cancels the menu.
        
        <!- begin index ->
        Using the manual index mode 'man <filename> new' will scan the file
        for special HTML comments, which MUST start at the beginning of a
        line.
        Sections can be assigned to keywords with the following construction:
        <!- begin keyword ->
        ...
        <!- end ->
        A man call to keyword will then show the text in between the 'begin'
        and 'end'.
        
        <!- alias keyword existingkeyword ->
        Assigns a new keyword to an existing keyword. This is done recursively,
        so please try to avoid endless loops! In which file(s) the alias are
        defined doesn't matter
        
        <!- end ->
        

TODO
        
        - Automatically indexing all manfiles
        - Time check on the indexed files
