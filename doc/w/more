Print <file> in pages and waits after each page for input.
Accepted commands are then:

       [CR], d  : next page
       u, b     : last page
       f        : go to the first page
       l        : go aynchronously to the last page
       a        : redisplays the actual page
       <nr>     : go to line <nr>
       /<regexp>: scan forward until line matching <regexp>
       /        : repeats last /<regexp> command
       ?        : lists these commands as help
       q        : quits more.

Each page is by default 16 lines long.
