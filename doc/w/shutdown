Command: shutdown [[time] <min>] [<reason>]

Start Armageddon and set him to shutdown after a delay 
of <min> minutes (default is 5 minutes). 
If you set the delay to 0, shutdown will occur immediately.
Don't do this if you don't have a very good reason for it (and it's
also a very good idea to state that reason).
And if possible, give players enough time to sell their things and save.

NOTE: In general, you won't need this command!
      Rebooting the game doesn't make anything faster!
      I repeat: Rebooting the game does not make anything faster!
      Remember that there are many players standing around as statue!
NOTE TWO:  Okay, shutdowns do speed things up, but the main concern
           is that the game may not get re-started correctly.
NOTE THREE:  A shutdown for no reason is good in moderation, it keeps
             the players on their toes, wouldn't want them to get
             too relaxed.
