smv <source> <destination>

Copies a file <source> to a file <destination> (default is the current
directory). If <destination> doesn't exist, it is created. 
Existing destination files are not overwritten.
After that, <source> is removed.

If <destination> is a directory, the correct basename is automatically 
added, e.g. 'cp foo.c /players/jrwiz' would move the file foo.c into 
the file /players/jrwiz/foo.c .

<source> may be wildcarded, then the work is done asynchronously.

Of course you must have the right to write into the destination
directory.

See also: w/mv, w/ls, w/ed, w/rm, w/cp, w/scp, w/join, w/faction, w/wildcards.
