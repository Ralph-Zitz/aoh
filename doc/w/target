SYNOPSIS
  target <tname>
  target list

  target <tname> liv[ing]  <name>
  target <tname> pl[ayer]  <name>
  target <tname> obj[ect]  <spec>|<filename>
  target <tname> room      <spec>|<filename>
  target <tname> target    <spec>

  target <tname> remove

DESCRIPTION
  The commands goto, in and trans accept symbolic targets, which are
  managed using this command.

  The first two forms return the setting of a specific target <tname>
  resp. the list of all set targets.

  The last form removes the setting of target <tname>.

  The other forms set the target named <tname> to a specific
  destination. Using the keywords 'living', 'player', 'object' and
  'room' (and their synonymes) the target may specified more exactly.
  If none of the keywords is given, all variants are tried in this
  order until a target is found.

  target <tname> living|player <name> sets the target to then named
    living/player is. It must be existing at the time of the command!
  target <tname> object <spec>|<filename> sets the target to the named
    object. It must be existing at the time of the command!
  target <tname> room <spec>|<filename> sets the target to the named
    room. It must be existing at the time of the command!
  target <tname> target <spec> sets the target to the setting of the
    other target.

  <spec> is an object specification like in the get/drop commands.
  <filename> is the object_name() of the object (the file itself needn't
    exist). Trailing ".c"s are ignored, filealiases applied.
