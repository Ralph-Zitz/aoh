Concept: Wildcards

Some commands dealing with files accept wildcards. This means that
the basename of a file may be wildcarded with one or more '*', where
each '*' matches any number of arbitrary characters.

Additionally, the specification of a directory alone stands for all files 
in it.

Only the basename may be wildcarded: /doc/*/* would be illegal, whereas
/doc/efun/e* is legal and would match everthing in /doc/efun starting with
an 'e'.

But take care: since /players/jrwiz/* is a legal filename, only giving
a '~jrwiz' would surely address the full directory, '~jrwiz/*' may give
just one single file.

Wildcards are accepted by following commands:

  cp, mv, join, ls, lls, chk
