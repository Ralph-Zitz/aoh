To close the game temporarily for logins, put a file with the 'sorry, we're
closed' notice in here. The name of the file determines who may not login:

  NEWPLAYERS: no new players.
  PLAYERS   : no players.
  WIZARDS   : no wizards.

Actually, wizards are always allowed to login, but if WIZARDS exists, they
are given the opportunity to abort the login.

Another file can be used to stop ftp access: FTP . Easy, isn't it?
