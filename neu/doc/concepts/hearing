SYNOPSIS
	#include <messages.h>

DESCRIPTION - hearing
	Normally, audio communication is simply programmed using
	write(), say() and tell_object().
	However, players should have the possibility to ignore other
	players, thus 'say's, 'tell's and 'shout's needs to be done in
	an interceptable way.

	OSB does it by using messages for such normal communication:

	  MSG_Hear  "Hear":
	    string HEAR_TYPE
	      The type of this audio message.
	    string HEAR_TEXT
	      The text the recipient is to hear.

	The possible types are these:

	  HEAR_SAY      "say"
	  HEAR_TELL     "tell"
	  HEAR_SHOUT    "shout"
	  HEAR_PSHOUT   "pshout"
	  HEAR_WSHOUT   "wshout"
	  HEAR_HSHOUT   "hshout"
	  HEAR_WHISPER  "whisper"
	  HEAR_CONVERSE "converse"
	  HEAR_ECHOTO   "echoto"
	  HEAR_ECHO     "echo"
	  HEAR_PECHO    "pecho"
	  HEAR_WECHO    "wecho"
	  HEAR_ECHOALL  "echoall"
