DESCRIPTION
	Livings are probably the most important entity in a Mud,
	because they are those who interact with the players directly,
	and can issue commands on their own.
	However, they are also the most difficult class of object to
	master, because living things appear in a great variety of
	modifications.

	In OSB, a living is a 'walking container', described by a bunch
	of additional attributes. The body of a living is covered by
	an intrinsic armour, the living's skin, and the living can
	have a set of 'hands' to perform actions (these 'hands' can
	also be used as heads, tails, or whatever).
	The heart of a living (and a bunch of callouts) takes care of a
	livings automatic actions.

	Since livings exist in a great variety, there not just one
	/std/living in OSB. Instead there are:

	  /std/living: the very basic living, containing the minimum
	               features.
	  /std/npc   : an advanced living, more difficult to use, but
	               with greater flexibility in its actions.
	  /std/player: the object interactive players get to use.
	  /std/wizard: the object interactive wizards get to use.

	Of course all are descendants of /std/living.

	All these classes of livings are programmed in a modular way,
	so creating livings 'inbetween' is quite simple.
	Let's assume you want a standard living, which can
	additionally be commanded to take or drop things.
	To achieve this, you'd simply do:

	  inherit "/std/living";         // The basic functionality
	  inherit "/std/npc/basiccmds";  // Simple commands

	and possibly add some wrapper code for the initialisation.


	For easier creation, there is a set of preconfigured
	monstertypes in /obj/monster/ available.
