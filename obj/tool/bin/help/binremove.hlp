SYNOPSIS
       binremove <command> 

DESCRIPTION
       Remove the given command(s) from the command list.
       It is possible to specify a regular expression for
       the command name, but $ will always be added to avoid
       matching problems. For example 'binremove .*' will
       remove all commands, 'binremove x.*' will remove all
       commands starting with x. More info: man regexp.
