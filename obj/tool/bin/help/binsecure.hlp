SYNOPSIS
       binsecurity [on|off]

DESCRIPTION
       Turn security 'off' or 'on'. Remember that someone
       else can do almost everything with you once it is
       turned off. Therefor a message is given every heart-
       beat to remind you. Note: This does not affect the
       security checking done by the commands itself.
