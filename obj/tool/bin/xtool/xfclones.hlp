SYNOPSIS
      xfclo(nes) [-v] <filename>

DESCRIPTION
      Lists all clones of <filename>. Optional, using -v, lists the
      environments of those objects too. This function is quite
      expensive and may result in too long evaluations. Only use it
      if you really need to.

EXAMPLE
      xfclones /obj/tool/xtool
      xfclones -v /obj/torch
