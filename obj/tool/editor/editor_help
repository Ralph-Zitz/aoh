This is Hanarra's handy editor.  I find it more convenient and easier
than the standard editor, I hope you will too.

Commands:

file <filename>          --- set a file to edit.
esave                     --- save the current buffer.
discard                  --- discard the current buffer.
print <range>            --- prints a range of line numbers.
print [all/more/less]    --- print all lines, or a chunk of lines.
insert [#/start/end]     --- inserts text after given arguement.
delete <range>           --- deletes a line or range of lines.
change <#>               --- change a line.
info                     --- prints some info about the current buffer.
lines [on/off]           --- turn on/off the numbering of lines.
chunk <#>                --- define # of lines for "print [more/less]".
find <string>            --- search for string from start of buffer.
next <string> optional   --- find string from current line.
prev <string> optional   --- find string before current line.

NOTES:

To stop inserting lines, enter a "."
With the change command, use a '.' to leave line unchanged.

<range> means a line number or a range of line numbers, format is 
either a number or two numbers separated by '-'.  You may also use
"start" and "end" instead of a number.

optional means that you dont have to include this arguement if you
defined the <string> with a previous search, next, or prev command.
