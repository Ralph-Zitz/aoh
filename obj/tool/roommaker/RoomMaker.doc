    RoomMaker V0.94

    (c) Sique 10/1992


The RoomMaker was build for to make it easy to build own rooms interactively.

The current Version (0.94) has the following features:
- Builds rooms from /obj/room
- Can configure
  * internal short/long description
  * normal exits (given with AddExit())
  * items given with AddItem()
  * details given with AddDetail()
- Can comment the file
- If the file to create already exists befor starting the RoomMaker, it renames
  the file to <filename>~
- If the file will be created more than one, the older version will renamed to
  <filename>.old
- Escape the RoomMakerShell with ~!<cmd> for one command or
- Escape the RoomMakerShell with ~!, and restart them with ~m
- go into new room while creating them
- A (very small) text editor with the possibility to delete the last line
- shows the current file

Planned:
- Include old roomfiles and change them
- Configuration of other properties
- Configuration of doors
- Change the filename while creating the roomfile
- Include of files in texts
- Maybe "dig" exits (that means, the RoomMaker tries to change the file of the
  destination room of an exit for to create an exit back)
- Maybe change of the standartfile of inheritance (that means, the RoomMaker
  could be used as a "PubMaker" or a "ShopMaker" etc.

The code of the RoomMaker

The code contains of 9 new files and 6 standart files

First: Excuse for the VERY unreadable code. But for to implement the
       RoomMakerShell I used excessively the input_to() function.
       So I can't write them in a normal C-like looking code.
       I implemented 2 new functions in stdfuns.c, void SetLabel(string, mixed)
       and mixed QueryLabel(string) that I used for the "return"-adresses of
       the input_to()-call. Also I often ended a function with a
       "return call_other(this_object(),QueryLabel(<funlabel>))"
       That looks like BASIC ("GOTO <label>") and is also. *sigh*

I hope I can use the funs defined in stdfuns.c for to implement other Makers
like a WeaponMaker or a MonsterMaker...
