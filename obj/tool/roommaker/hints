Some hints how to use the roommaker:

1. If you escape with "~!<cmd>" and the <cmd> starts an input loop
   (like more, man, note, mail etc.) you can't return to the input
   loop of the roommaker. If you need them (maybe you want to look
   at the neighbor roomfile) please escape simply with "~!" and do
   return to the maker with "~m".

2. You can change the file name by typing "f" or "filename" in the
   menu. This possibility can be (ab)used to write some rooms with
   the same descriptions (Hey, Killroy!). Simply save the file and
   change the filename later.

3. If you want to change a property, you can do that:
   1. by typing the #defined name (P_LONG, P_READ_MSG etc.)
   2. by typing the string labeling the property (Long, ReadMsg etc.)
   3. by typing the lowercased name of the property (long, readmsg
      etc.)
   All values need to be written as we need it in a file.
   Never type 'string' instead of '"string"'!
