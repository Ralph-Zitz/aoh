The belt of wizards is a small tool that is no replacement for any existing
tool, but a tool that provides several additional commands other tools don't
have. You have to decide on your own how useful or useless they are.
The commands are:

wexam(wx), wlook(wl), wload, wgrep, wquit, whelp, wman, wmore, wclone,
wrml, wmacro, wlist, wfind, wrepl, wedit, whead, wmess, won, woff,
recho, lsay(#), lecho

You can get a description of each command by typing 'wman <name>' (provided
the lazy wiz Joern has already written the docs :-).
If you type 'ac <armour class>' you can set the armour class of the belt.
If you type 'bright <brightness>' you can set the brightness of the belt.
If you have a file 'startup.c' in you homedirectory that object will be
loaded when you log in and the function 'startup' will be called in that
object. If you quit using 'wquit' the function 'quit' will be called in
that object.
Example for a startup.c :

void startup() {
   object jo;
   shout(
"All the girls suddenly have an expression of disgust on their faces.\n\
Joern must have entered the world.\n");
   write("Your belt starts to glitter.\n");
   jo=find_player("waragos");
   jo->SetSmell("Waragos smells like a wolf.\n");
   jo->SetNoise("You hear a strange noise coming from Waragos's stomach.\n");
}

void quit() {
   shout(
"There's great jubilation as Joern finally leaves the world.\n");
}
