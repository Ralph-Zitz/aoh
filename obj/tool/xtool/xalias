SYNOPSIS
      xalias <alias> <command>

DESCRIPTION
      Without any arguments show the current aliases in use. <alias> must
      be one word. <command> is the string to be executed when typing the
      <alias>.
      The <command> string can contain replacement marks. Those marks will then
      be replaced by arguments which may be given behind the alias.
      Currently there are these three types of marks:

      - "!<n>" these marks will then replaced by the n-th argument that may
        be given behind the alias. If an argument could not be replaced by a
        mark then it will be appended at the end of the command.
      - "!*" this mark will be replaced by all arguments given behind the
        alias.
      - "!<n>*" these marks will be replaced by all arguments starting with the
        n-th argument and ending with the last one.

      If the <command> string doesn't contain one of the last two kind of marks
      then all arguments which could not be replaced by marks will be added at
      the end of the execution string.

EXAMPLES
      xalias xl xlook
      When typing "xl", "xlook" will be executed.

      xalias gag xdo 5#smile
      When typing "gag", "xdo 5#smile" will be executed which will result
      in executing "smile" 5 times.

      xalias gc get !* from corpse
      Typing "gc coins" will be executed as "get coins from corpse".
      Typing "gc sword 2" will be executed as "get sword 2 from corpse".

      xalias wfrog xcall !1->Set(P_FROG,!obj->Query(P_FROG))
      This alias simulates the "wfrog" command of Uranus Wand of Wizards :)

      As you can see, you can extend the Xtool with your own commands just
      by defining some aliases.
