SYNOPSIS
      xwho [mail|ip|race|guild|domain|stats|jobs]

DESCRIPTION
      Without any argument this command behaves like the normal people

      email address. With the argument "ip" it will list all players with
      their host name and ip number. If the argument is "race" or "guild"
      you will get a list of all players with these attributes. "domain"
      will show the domain(s) of the current players. With "stats" it
      will print some stats information of all players. And with
      "jobs" it will print the jobs the all players (Nightfall and
      One Step Beyond only).
