What has roots as nobody sees,
Is taller than trees
   Up, up it goes,
   And yet never grows?
Mountain

Thirty white horses on a red hill,
   First they Champ,
   Then they stamp,
Then they stand still.
Teeth; Tooth

Voiceless is cries
Wingless flutters,
Toothless bites,
Mouthless mutters.
Wind

An eye in the blue face
Saw an eye in a green face.
'That eye is like to this eye'
Said the first eye,
'But in low place,
Not in high place.'
Sun on the daisies; sun daisy; sun daisies

In cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills
   And empty holes fills.
It comes first an follows after,
   Ends life, kills laughter.
Dark

A box withoug hinges, key or lied.
Yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Egg

Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.
Fish

No-legs lay on one-leg,
two-legs sat near on three-legs,
four-legs got some.
Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a stool, and cat has the bones.; fish table man stool cat; fish table person stool cat; fish table man stool dog; fish table person stool dog

This thing all things devours;
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.
Time
