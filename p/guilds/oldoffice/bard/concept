Here are some words about the bards guild:

The guild is still under construction and in a test phase. We finished
some features:
Bard's get an instrument from the guildmaster - a lute - with the following 
features:
If the level of a player is high enough he/she can play songs on the
lute. The lute contains the following songs:

Number  Song                        Level
      1. Sentimental Journey            1
         (With this song you can emotion a psionic)
      2. Fionn's Prelude                1 
         (makes light) 
      3. Safety Song                    3 
         (calm monster) 
      4. Woodland Melody                5
         (create a magic shield)  
      5. Jontom's Tune                  7
         (see invisible player)  
      6. The Song of Fear               9
         (monster run away)  
      7. Sounds of Nightfall           11
         (make everybody in the same environment invisible)  
      8. MegaDeath                     13  
         (same as the scroll warstrike)
      9. Jontom's Masterpiece          15
         (create a sword with WC 20)  
      10. The Song Of A Joyful Life     17 
         (heal a bit faster) 
     11. The Music of the Ainur        18 
         (combination of 6.,1. and 3.)

Another instrument can be bought in the guildshop - a flute:
If someone plays the flute, a little dancebear arrives and dances
to the music. Surrounding players feel a great desire to give a gage
(1 gold coin) to the fluteplayer.

Below the guildhouse are some catacombs for the guild members. They contain
  1. a pub  
  2. a postoffice, 
  3. a shop
  4. a church, where members of Bards Guild can login
        where members can buy an atlas of avalon and an other instrument, a
        little flute, and last but not least 
  5. an office
        with the 'old england discussion board' where members can tell 
        their critics and problems. 
  6. a bank,
  7. The news service center

This features are just under construction so that they can change a little bit.

In the guildhouse is a little chest with two scrolls, where players can take 
one scroll every 'refresh':
  1. vandalize
  2. holywater
