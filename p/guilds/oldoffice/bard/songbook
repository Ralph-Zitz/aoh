The Bard's Songbook
by Grough and Pumuckel 1993
Vice Lords of Avalon and Leaders of the Bard's Guild

   The songbook is an implementation for Bard's to actually sing songs
as opposed to just playing an instrument.  The guild will soon depend
on the songbook for spells and the like, but for now, it is a simple
creation. When a bard sings a song from  the songbook, everyone in the
room hears it.  These songs will range from little ditties to 
full songs, to epics of Nightfall players, and histories of Nightfall, too

Bards can mail their songs to Grough or  Pumuckel, and they will be added 
to the songbook, if accepted.  The songs will be credited to the person
submitting the song.  Any song will be considered, as long as it is in 
good taste.

In the future, the songbook will complement the guild instrument as a way
to cast spells, but this has not been implemented yet.  After a 'learn' has
been added, the spells will be added to the songbook, as a new source of 
player songs, for the lute (or the new instrument when it is implemented)
Hopefully, this will happen in the near future, and this doc will be rewritten
as changes are made.
