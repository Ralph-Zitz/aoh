An idea i find in Nirvana4 too the guildcommanders:

Guildcommander are some player with the highest guild level.
The guild builder looks them out to help him by getting the guild
clean and try to make the guild more attractive to the players.

The guild commanders will get great powers, so be sure that the players
are serious and didnt misuse this powers.

Powers i think a guild commander should have are:

- query <player> : Get the current guild stats of a player
- banish <player> : Banish a player from the all guild ( this will be only when
                    a damn good reason is given like attacking other 
                    members of the guilds or player killing with guild powers)
- promote <player> : Will raise the player one guild level (this should be
                     promotions for very good playing or helping)
- fix <player> : return a player to the guild back when he/she lost his/her
                 membership
- revok<player> : strips a player of their membership, guildlevel, 
                    guildexperience.

May be if a guild coder likes it the commander can have a bonus abilitie
like a great spell or some bonus commands.
