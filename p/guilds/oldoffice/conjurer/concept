The conjurer's guild is different from the old Mage's guild we had in NF-I.
There are no libraries and practice cells in this guild. The members of this
guild have to find scrolls and memorize the spells written on that scrolls.
The spells will then be added to thier spellbooks, but they know the spells
very bad at first. They have to keep on memorizing the spells until they
know them better (this will not take as long as in the old Mage's guild).
If a player buys some empty pieces of paper, he can scribe spells from his
spellbook or other magicbooks which can be found in Nightfall. The copy
of the scroll will of course be worthless, so that they can't just copy
1000 scrolls and sell them in the magicshop. They can just cast those
spells or memorize them or give them to lower-level conjurers so they can
memorize them. I will now give you an overview over the spells of the
conjurers. The LEVEL is the level a player has to have if he wants to
memorize the scroll. But before I list the spells, I have to mention that
guild membership in this guild is not alignment- or race-dependent and that
there are no additional quests for guild members like in the Paladins' or
Warrior's guild. The drawback of this guild is that the members can have a
strength higher than 17 and they can't wield weapons with WC > 15.

The spells casted by conjurers are more powerful than the spells of sor-
cerers, but conjurer have only one kind of spells. They can just conjure
some things or monsters. They have no Combat Spells, no Detection Spells
and no Manipulation Spells.

 It is possible to change classes from conjurer to sorcerer without the loss
 of the know spells, but it will cost a player 1/2 of the XPs.
 Joining this guild costs 2000 coins.
 The spellbook that you get, when you join the guild is described in
 /d/woodland/joern/doc/spellbook
 If a player 'severs' the guild (leaveing it with the loss of all spells)
 it will only cost 1/6 of the experience.
 If a player fails to cast a spell (if he knows a spell very bad 70% of the
 spells will fail) something totally different than expected will happen.
 Most likely he will get hit by a lightnig, a giant fist or something like
 that, or it will rain dead fish, or for example if he fails to cast 'light'
 he will get a kind of sunglasses instead of a torch.
