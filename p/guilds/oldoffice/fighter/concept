The origin of the fighters' guild:

After Sir Marvin and the best fighters of Nightfall fell in the great war
against the orcs there were no good fighters for a long time. The only good
fighters that survied the battle at Crescent Lake were the guards of king
Joern. There was a very old swordmaster among them who decided to teach his
wisdom to the younger half-elves. At first he teached the the art of sword-
handling in the yard of his house, but soon he had too much disciples to
teach them all alone. He had earned a lot of money and so he decided to build
a guildhall and let some of his best disciples help him in teaching the 
others. The fighters' guild in Lorinia was soon reputed as one of the best
guilds for those who wanted to learn the art of swordsplay.
People from other lands came to Lorinia to join the guild. There were also
a few orc and trolls which wanted to join the guild, but they were not
allowed to enter the town. They became very angry and threatend to burn down
Lorinia if they won't be let in, but Joern told them that he didn't want
orcs or trolls in his town. If they wanted to join the fighters guild it would
be better to open a branch of the guild in Dark City or the hell.
Joern gave some money to the old swordmaster and commanded him to build a
guildhall in Dark City and teach some trolls there until one of them would
be able to take over the job as a guildmaster, then he should return to his
own guild in Lorinia. 
The guild was build and the building was called warriors' guild by the 
trolls for warrior is the only word they have for a good fighter.
