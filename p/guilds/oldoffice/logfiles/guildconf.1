Logfile of the guild conference, 21-Apr-93.
A summary will be posted on the guilds discussion board.

Rover says: Well. Balgarion, you should start, because you said you don't have
Rover says: too much time.
Loco leaves home.
Balgarion says: hmm i ???????
Rover says: *sigh* Okay, then me.
Balgarion says: iam hear to listen and say some words to some topics.
Sique starts to write a file. Please don't disturb!
Rover says: Well, the first problem is the total lack of standard spells.
Rover says: Players who don't want to join a guild have no use for their SP.
Pepel still considers spells to be non-/std
Flagor a horse-pantomime arrives.
Pepel says: tell and shout
Flagor says: Hi
Rover says: So it's really unfair. Tell and Shout don't do any good in combat,
Rover says: Pepel... :-)
Pepel has learned different in the karate course yesterday :-)
Goofy doesn't smoke, but arrives in a puff of it.
Goofy says:  Hi !
Rover says: Well, if you think that there should be no more spells built into
Rover says: the player object, I'll have to code some extra objects.
Sique stops to write a file and aborts.
Rover says: Like the spellcasting diploma in TubMud.
Balgarion says: nope not this thing.
Rover says: Any other ideas?
Flagor usess the UKI-Goshi.
Joern says: Why not implementing spells in the player-obj.? I thought Mateese was going to do that.
Balgarion says: how about the spells from the old playerfile?
Joern shrugs helplessly.
Pepel shrugs helplessly.
Pepel says: mateese is away this week
Balgarion says: and how about thinking about some races things which use spellpoints.
Rover says: Okay, I guess it's not totally urgent, but we need some
Rover says: spells/abilities for non-guild-members.
Pepel says: Hyp is going to put `Skills' into the player object
Balgarion says: i think we should think about races and spellpointsusing stuff!
Pepel says: so that standard-actions can be easily re-defined by guild objects etc
Rover nods at Pepel.
Pepel says:  like put/get/drop/look/jump
Joern says: I'm looking forwar to that :-)
Joern says: forward
Rover says: Would be great. Unfortunately nobody knows when Hyp is going to
Rover says: implement anything of his new stuff into Nightfall.
Pepel says: he showed a big pile of listings to jhary and me on easter weekend
Pepel says: currently he cant log on to his test mud -> needs some more debugging :-)
Rover sighs deeply.
Balgarion nods solemnly.
Rover says: Next point would be the so called "Seers".
Flagor leaves home.
Pepel nods solemnly.
Rover says: A seer has in my opinion too much power. He should not be called
Rover says: "Superplayer".
Rover says: Eg. teleport TO moving object.
Pepel nods solemnly.
Joern says: Seer and Superplayer is not the same
Pepel nods solemnly.
Rover says: Yes, and I would really like to introduce real superplayers to
Rover says: Nightfall.
Pepel nods solemnly.
Rover says: With special areas designed for them exclusively (and special
Rover says: quests)
Joern says: Ende and Mithrandir are Superplayers
Autosave...
Joern says: But we don't have special abilities or quest for them at the moment.
Rover says: The guilds should provide the powers, and those should be of
Rover says: course much better than the normal player abilities.
Rover says: yes, but I want to at least MENTION the problem.
Balgarion says: so here is the point to think about guild commanders for superplayers.
Rover says: I cannot speak for the other guilds, but the Psionics will support
Rover says: the superplayer concept.
Balgarion nods: at rover
Rover says: Additionally, I think we should have a clear guideline for player
Rover says: titles.
Rover says: As it is, nearly no player knows who is a wizard and who not.
Joern nods solemnly.
Rover says: So we should either have one layout for all player titles, or the
Rover says: "who" list must give more information.
Balgarion says: why not use a added title for guildtitles?
Goofy leaves home.
Balgarion says: like blablabla the superninja (player:19)
Rover says: Joern's guilds currently all add a [race,guild] to the title...
Rover says: Could as well include the level. Good idea, Balgarion.
Simpson leaves home.
Pumuckel says: What about a who like the 'who' comand in the helptool?
Pepel says: player level, or exp level?
Rover says: player level.
Pepel says: IMHO, includ ethe level only if it is not to be detected from the title itself
Balgarion nods solemnly.
Rover says: I guess every guild will have its own title list. And HLP
Rover says: (high-level players) should be able to choose their own title.
Rover says: With the guild and race added.
Pepel nods solemnly.
Rover says: Like "Testrov the lord of Archwizbashing [demon,psionic,26]"
Rover says: So the "title" command should also vanish out of the Seer.
Rover says: Any more comments about seers?
Pepel lets emacs listen for a while
Rover says: (I think they should be completely erased... :-)
Rover says: Okay, next topic: Guild commanders.
Rover says: Balgarion you already mentioned this. What were your ideas about
Rover says: them?
Balgarion says: ok my ideas about them was -
Balgarion says: first a high level player as the communiction poart between players and guildwizzes
Joern has started a number-puzzle.
Balgarion kicks Joern.
Balgarion says: second a control part for the players.
Balgarion says: i think all had read the docfile about guildcommanders in my directory.
Joern nods solemnly.
Balgarion says: it is under concepts/guildc.
Rover says: Well, for that we would need control objects. Every guild should
Rover says: have one object that keeps a record of what is going on.
Balgarion says: there everything is explained
Rover says: 1. Memberlist
Balgarion says: hmm i never think we need a control object.
Rover says: 2. Spell usage
Autosave...
Rover says: 3. functions for guild handling (for the commanders)
Balgarion says: i didnt think we need it for spell usage.
Rover says: Sometimes it can be a great advantage to have statistics over
Rover says: ability usage.
Balgarion starts to think very deeply.
Hmmmm.
Joern plucks pensive at his beard.
Balgarion says: hey do you all sleep
Balgarion says: we are here to discuss
Rover says: If a powerful ability is used too much because it's too cheap, you
Rover says: can easily detect this.
Balgarion says: ok
Balgarion kicks All.
Rover says: And there might be some abilities that need logging. "force" for
Rover says: example. A HLP-ability of the psionics.
Rover says: some commands will be forbidden, like "quit" and "kill player",
Rover says: but you can still do a lot of sh*t with it.
Rover says: Well, master objects are not so important right now...
Rover says: I think next topic should be guild rules.
Balgarion says: hallo wach oder wir setzen einfach guildrules.
Rover says: First rule: No guild that is not approved by the department of
Rover says: guilds should be open to players.
Balgarion nods solemnly.
Rover says: That includes players "helping" wizards with testing and
Rover says: debugging,
Simpson arrives in a puff of smoke.
Rover says: One not approved (and absolutely not debugged) guild had a real
Rover says: player as member.
Rover says: next thing: No player should be able to join a guild with less
Rover says: than 1600 XP.
Joern's stick flickers and goes out.
Rover says: (Or perhaps 1522, that's the old margin for Level 4)
Rover says: And I think they should already have earned some questpoints, at
Rover says: least one.
Rover says: third proposal: Every guild MUST have some specific quests for
Rover says: their members.
Joern says: But some do only need one or two?
Rover says: Of course it will take some time to build these.
Rover says: at least one quest, I think.
Pumuckel nods solemnly.
Pumuckel sighs deeply.
Rover says: Depends on the abilities provided by the guild, and the additional
Rover says: drawbacks (if any)
Joern nods solemnly.
Rover says: Right now, we cannot say: This guild must have these drawbacks and
Rover says: this guild those, because they are all not finished.
Rover says: So it should be a general guideline only. The fine tuning will
Rover says: come later.
Rover says: Next proposal: Some guilds might want to introduce tithing. That's
Rover says: fine with me.
Rover says: Again: Do what you think is appropriate (and discuss it with me or
Rover says: Balgarion :-)
Hyp arrives in a puff of smoke (very cheap trick)..
Hyp says: hi
Rover says: Hi Hyp!
Joern says: What is tithing?
Balgarion gracefully bows to Hyp.
Rover says: For germans: "Der Zehnte", also eine regelmaessige Abgabe an die
Rover says: Gilde.
Joern says: I can't find tithing in that damn Langenscheidt
Rover says: Some kind of Guild Tax.
Hyp says: was geht denn hier ab?
Rover says: Guild conference
Hyp says: ups, da bin ich hier falsch
Hyp waves farewell.
Hyp leaves home.
Joern says: Go on
Rover says: Next thing: Race restrictions.
Sique says: Awaked again...
Rover says: Some guilds don't accept all races as members.
Rover says: Like Joern's Paladins.
Sique says: Yes... like the monks... a demon can't be a monk.
Rover says: I don't like that very much, because I hate racism, even in a
Rover says: fantasy game.
Joern says: But there is a similar guild for orcs and trolls: the warriors
Pumuckel nods at Rover.
Sique says: In the monastry it's not my racism, it's the racism of the catholic church and the christianism :)
Rover says: Yes Joern, that's another point: Why do we have two guilds in
Rover says: Nightfall that are nearly exact copies?
Rover says: The difference between the two is so small that you could as well
Rover says: merge them.
Joern says: I wanted them to be similar.
Rover says: yes, and I don't want them to. How can we find a compromise? (if
Rover says: any)
Rover says: Guilds should all be different.
Joern says: Because I don't want orcs and demons as Paladins, but they could as well be  Warriors.
Joern says: The Warriors Guild is just a kind of local branch of the Paladins guild.
Rover sighs deeply.
Joern says: And the people of Dark City are evil while they are nice in Lorinia.
Sique says: It's the mirror-image..
Rover says: Then perhaps totally contrary.
Joern says: But Orcs shouldn't be able to use magic
Rover says: Define different goals for the two guilds.
Joern says: and paladins have the book of prayers
Rover says: Paladins are no magic users in my imagination. They rely on divine
Rover says: powers.
Rover says: And they "pray" for miracles. That's their magic.
Rover says: And why shouldn't Orcs be able to pray to an evil god?
Rover says: Or even to a good one?
Goofy doesn't smoke, but arrives in a puff of it.
Rover says: You could include a check for alignment. If the paladin sinks
Rover says: below a certain margin, he has "strayed from the path".
Joern says: Okay, but why don't we allow guilds to have branches in some towns. It's a long way for a troll to come to Lorinia.
Rover says: That's a different thing.
Rover says: Branch offices are no problem, if the domain lords agree. But here
Rover says: we speak of two totally different guilds.
Rover says: No. Not totally different. That was the problem... :-)
Simpson left the world.
Rover says: I guess we should discuss later, in private...
Joern nods solemnly.
Joern says: Okay, go on
Rover says: As a general rule: I want the guilds in Nightfall to be unique.
Rover says: That does not mean "guilds may not have branch offices" as long as
Rover says: all guild members may enter them.
Rover says: next topic: guild documentation.
Sique says: Hm... I think also, that it could be very boring to see many guilds being just a subset of some "masterguild". That's also an argument against a /std/spell.
Rover says: I don't think that we need a /std/guild after Hyp installed the
Rover says: new combat system.
Sique says: Oh, no /std/guild...
Rover says: Since the stats will be raised automagically, and what else is a
Rover says: /std/guild good for?
Sique says: What should the /std/guild contain?
Sique nods at Rover.
Rover says: The guild specific abilities and attributes must be handled by
Rover says: each guild alone.
Goofy leaves home.
Rover says: Well, I'm not sure about that point, though. That's a point to
Rover says: discuss after Hyp did what he should do...
Rover grins demonically.
Rover says: Again: guild documentation
Sique says: Documentation is 50% of the whole compuer science
Rover says: It would be nice if every guild programmer could write three
Rover says: different doc-files for his/her guild.
Joern says: the 50% i hate most ;-)
Rover says: One for the general concept.
Sique says: Three????? 
Rover says: I know, Joern... :-)
Rover says: One for the rules, one for the abilities.
Sique says: Hm... but arent rules+abilities=concept?
Rover says: No. Concept means: Background/history of the guild. Where is it
Rover says: located. On what philosophy/way of life is it based and so on...
Aren't we all somehow part of the whole concept?
Rover says: Rules is: Guild Id, Requirements for joining, handling of
Rover says: abilities (chances), raising stats/attributes, drawbacks and the
Rover says: like.
Rover says: the last file should contain a list of all abilities provided by
Rover says: the guild.
Rover says: With a description of each ability and perhaps also its cost in
Rover says: SP.
Balgarion says: sorry have to go bye
Balgarion waves farewell.
Sique says: Me too... my wife is waiting me.
Balgarion left the world.
Sique dissappears, leaving his wooden leg. It burns to dust.
A cloud of dust blows home.
Joern grins evily.
Rover says: Next (and probably last) topic: What do we have? How far are the
Rover says: guilds yet?
Rover says: The guild of psionics is still rather far away from completion.
Joern says: As you know I'll have to make some changes to the vampires and warriors, but the others are ready.
Rover says: Well...
Rover grins demonically.
Joern says: I may have to change a few more things when the new fighting system is ready.
Rover says: Okay, to continue with my guild: Estimated date for opening will
Rover says: be end of May. (If I don't have to make HUGE changes due to new
Rover says: combat)
Rover says: Pumuckel, how far are you with the Bards?
Rover pokes Pumuckel in the ribs.
Joern says: Do you all have a LAG? The answers are coming so slow.
Rover grins at Joern.
Rover says: Brain lag, if any...
Rover says: I guess that was about it.
