Some of the abilities in this list are not implemented yet,
and the list may change again in the future.


Perception Abilities:
---------------------

 1.) Know (basic perception) : 
     Gives the player information about a single npc or player.
     The player will be able to get more and more information
     with higher perception ratings.
     Note: All information will be granted in words, not in absolute
           values. (Currently absolute values are given, but that will
                    change when the guild is opened for players)

 2.) Detect (Pcn 7+12) :
     Evil:  Recursively check the surrounding rooms for evil/saintly
            npcs that would attack the player and give something like
            'You sense danger to the north'. Diameter of area checked
            will grow with perception getting higher.
     Invis: Sense if invisible objects are present.

 4.) Vortex (Pcn 9) :
     Teleport the player to the vortex, a room in the guild building.

 5.) Astral Travel (Pcn 15) :
     Lets the player's mind walk about Nightfall while his body stays
     stationary. The player can return his mind to his body or move
     his body to his mind.

 6.) Locate Player(Pcn 16) :
     Gives the long description of another player's environment.

Superplayers:

     Listen (Pcn >19) :
     You hear and see what another player hears and sees.
     Some kind of 'snoop' for players. Duration is limited by time.

     Timetravel (Pcn >19) :
     Lets you jump back a certain amount of rooms. The last x rooms
     the player has visited are stored. If the player uses this
     ability, one room in the list is picked randomly to which he/she
     is then teleported, thus reversing the player's journey so far.
     (I don't think I will implement this, because it would eat up
      lots of memory and eval time.)


Influence Abilities:
--------------------

 1.) Telekinesis (basic influence) :
     Concentrate on lifting objects. Can be either directly into the
     player's inventory or into thin air, thus reducing the player's
     load. Maximum weight of load raises with attribute influence
     raising.

 2.) Stun (Ifl 5) :
     Stun the mind of a monster. It causes 5 to 10 HP damage.

 3.) Psychic Whip (Ifl 7) :
     Whip the mind of a monster. Causes 10 to 30 HP damage.
     Can be cast with 'Astral Travel' active, thus monsters in the
     player's mind environment can be hit.

 4.) Implant Thought (Ifl 8) :
     Implant a thought in another player's mind. He will get the message
     "You suddenly think <message>"
     This ability gets important in one of the guild quests.

 5.) Psionic Blast (Ifl 9) :
     Blast the mind of a monster. Causes 20 to 50 HP damage.
     Can be cast with 'Astral Travel' active.

 6.) Tame (Ifl 10) :
     Tame a monster by setting P_AGGRESSIVE to zero.
     (Perhaps also stopping a fight.)

 7.) Hold (Ifl 11) :
     Hold a monster by setting GoChance and P_WIMPY to zero.

 8.) Distract Player (Ifl 12) :
     Lets another player 'forget' to perform the next action he typed.
     (Another fun ability)

 9.) Confuse (Ifl 14) :
     (The most discussed psionic ability... :-)
     Confuse a monster and make it drop something.
     No wielded weapons, worn armour or marked objects !
     (e.g. questobjects. Currently there is no method defined for
      marking these objects, so every object can be dropped. *sigh*)

10.) Brain Drain (Ifl 15) :
     Drain the mind (spellpoints) of an enemy. Very effective on
     spellcasting monsters, after two or three drains, HP damage
     will be done.

11.) Paralyze (Ifl 16) :
     Trap a monster inside a field of energy. The monster will not be
     able to fight the player back.

12.) Subdue (Ifl 17) :
     Force a monster to do something.
     Players will be forced to 'kneel in submission' (use it for fun).

13.) Death Grip (Ifl 18) :
     Crush the heart of a monster. This will do 25 HP damage every
     10 seconmds to it. If a monster is not intelligent enough it will
     not notice the source of its pain. Players of level 19 can attack
     monsters in the room they are seeing with "Astral Travel".
     This ability has a time limit.

14.) Mass Stun (Ifl 19) :
     Stun all monsters in the player's environment.
     Each will take 10 to 20 HP damage.

Superplayers:

     Invert Monster (Ifl >19) :
     Will invert the cerebral functions of a monster, thus inverting its
     long/shortdescription, chats and attack chats and perhaps reduce
     its stats a little bit (because of inverted attack movements)

     Dominate Monster (Ifl >19) :
     Turn a monster to a tame fighting animal (like Firestone's cat)
     Success depends on the monster's level. The monster will get a chance
     to escape domination every minute or so.

     Force Player (Ifl >19) :
     Reduced 'force' command for superplayers.
     Some commands will be forbidden, like 'quit' and the like.


Creativity Abilities:
---------------------

 1.) Aura (basic creativity) :
     Change the long and short description of a player to something
     different. May range from 'a faint glow' to 'a platinum dragon'.
     The player gets a new aura for every level of creativity, and
     the cost of this ability depends on the aura he/she chooses.
     This will also change the player's MsgIn and MsgOut.
     A superplayer may change his/her aura to what he/she wants.

 2.) Study (Cre 5) :
     Memorize the fundamental characteristics of an object.
     If it has psionic properties the player will be notified of this.
     With creativity of 18 the player can create a copy of this object.

 3.) Panic (Cre 7) :
     Cause a monster to panic and flee.

 4.) Illusion (Cre 9) :
     Create an illusion all players in the same room can see.
     They will get the message "You suddenly see <text>".

 5.) Mind Trap (Cre 11) :
     Trap a monster's mind inside a weapon, and give this weapon the
     monster's characteristics and (perhaps) special abilities.

 6.) Mark Object (Cre 12) :
     Give an object a psionic property. Any other psionic using 'study'
     on this object will get that psionic's message.

 7.) Hallucinate (Cre 14) :
     Cause a monster to see a hallucination. It will fight it until it
     is dead.

 8.) Mass Panic (Cre 16) :
     Cause all monsters in a room to panic and flee.

 9.) Digest Anorganic Matter (Cre 17) :
     Changes anorganic to edible objects. Players can refresh their
     soaked/stuffed status with this, it will not provide any healing.
     The player has to choose an object in his inventory, so no immobile
     objects can be eaten... :-)

10.) Create (Cre 18) :
     Create the object the player has studied.
     (In other words: clone it and put it in the player's environment)

Superplayers:

     Alter Density (Cre >19) :
     Will grow or shrink an object and give it a corresponding adjective.
     Also works on weapons (increase/decrease WC)
               and armours (fits giant/dwarf 
                            -- depends on the new combat system).

     Alter Reality (Cre >19) :
     Change the short and/or long description of a room or monster.
     The description will be reset after the player cancels the ability.


Discipline Abilities:
---------------------

 1.) Meditate (basic discipline) :
     The player connects his mind to the vortex (the source of all
     psionic energies) and gets his SP restored. The amount of SP/minute
     increases with the player's discipline attribute.

 2.) Mind Shield (Dis 5) :
     Create a mental shield about the player.
     The strength of the shield depends on the player's discipline.
     This ability is vital for psionics, because they are not allowed
     to wear certain types of armour, e.g. "armour" and "helmet".

 3.) Alter State (Dis 7) :
     This was planned to actually CHANGE the player's traits, unlike
     "Aura" where the player SEEMED to be different.
     I have to think on that one, though.

 4.) Body Weaponry (Dis 8) :
     Give the player's arms the hardness of platinum and the sharpness
     of the best of swords.
     The effectiveness of the weapon is dependent on the player's
     discipline.

 5.) Vanish (Dis 10) :
     Invisiblity. Need I say more? :-)

 6.) Ignore Pain (Dis 13) :
     Ignore the pain from your wounds.
     This will temporarily restore 40 HP of damage as long as the player
     concentrates on it. When the player stops concentrating he/she will
     lose the HP again.
     Concentration on this ability will be stored over logout, so the
     players can't cheat by logging in and out several times.

 7.) Metaconcert (Dis 15) :
     The player calls all other psionics to a 'metaconcert'.
     Players who join invest a certain amount of SP in it.
     If the announcing psionic considers having enough SP stored,
     he unleashes the strike on his enemy.
     The other psionics will get a snoop on the action for their
     participation.
     Note: Only high level players can call for a metaconcert, but
           EVERY psionic can join in and help him/her.

 8.) Transcend (Dis 17) :
     The guild building is located on the astral plane. It has
     several entrances all over Nightfall. The player can use this
     ability to travel the astral plane and teleport to one of these
     entrances. (Otherwise he can only leave the guild into the room
                 from where he entered.)
     This ability can only be used from within the vortex room.

 9.) Clot Blood (Dis 19) :
     The player uses his mind to stop the flow of blood from his
     wounds. This will temporarily restore 80 HP as long as the player
     concentrates on it. If the player stops concentrating, he will
     lose 40 HP again.
     Concentration on this ability will be stored over logout, so the
     players can't cheat by logging in and out several times.

Superplayers:

     Split Essence (Dis >19) :
     The player splits himself to several independent livings.
     The psionic's stats are lowered and then copied to his alter egos.
     This is only useful in fighting.

     Animate Matter (Dis >19) :
     The psionic concentrates on moving parts of the ground, so he can
     either attack his enemy by one blow from a giant hand or can create
     some kind of 'earth elemental' that acts like a fighting animal.


These are the abilities players can get in the guild of psionics.
