This guild was once just a little gag, but then Rover told me about a nice
RPG about vampires. There were some nice ideas and I decided to make a real
guild out of the vampires guild.
Now being a vampire is no longer just fun! They don't only have the ability
to bite NPCs and players, but they MUST bite players if they don't want to
loose some hitpoints.

Here is a little background information about the origin of the vampires'
guild:

After many lucky years of life in his castle in Transilvania, Vlad Dracula had
to give up the castle of his ancestors. The villagers did never mind him biting
the daughters of some poor farmers, but he went a bit too far and bit the 
wife of the mayor. Enraged people with torches and cludgels were coming up
the hill to his castle to burn it down. Vlad had to flee from them.
Following an invitation of his old friend Dr. Frankenstein he came to Night-
fall. When he visited Dark Island he found it a very nice place for his new
castle, but he needed someone to help him building the castle. So he went
out to bite lots of poor trolls which lived in a town near the hill which
he decided to put his castle on. The trolls had of course no crosses or
garlic to keep the vampires away from them, so it didn't take very long and
nearly all inhabitants of Dark City where vampires.
After a long time (thinking is not one of the trolls favourite occupations)
the trolls (sorry I wanted to say vampires) realized that they had some new
powers, but most of them where too stupid to make use of them.
One old and wise troll was intelligent enough to find out how to use this
new powers and he founded the vampires guild where he teaches the other
trolls how to use them. He has been sitting in that guild for quite a long
time now and maybe he is still there ...

If you want to visit the old troll go to /d/darkness/common/vguild.
