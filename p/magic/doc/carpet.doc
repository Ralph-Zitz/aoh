DESCRIPTION
        The flying carpets are the basic transport medium in OSB.
        They allow fast and easy transport to many locations throughout
	OSB.

	With the generic carpet lcoated in /p/magic/std/carpet.c 
	(MAGIC_CARPET in magic.h) you can define your own carpets and even
	your own carpet networks.

       Player commands to use the carpet are:
         sit down on carpet
	 leave carpet
	 fly <location>
	 read letters on carpet or read carpet

      At the moment these networks are defined in the standard carpet
        NETWORK_LARGE: large network throughout whole OSB
        NETWORK_SMALL: a smaller restricted network throughout whole OSB
        NETWORK_HLP  : connects some HLP locations
	  To get your own network or to add locations to existing networks
	  you need to contact the Department of Magic.
