The ideas in short.
- Each spell goes to /p/magic/spells/<class>/<spellname>.c
- Each spell is a separate spell "module" wich a defined
  set of functions which will be called by a spellserver, like
  "OnSucceedCasting", "OnFailCasting", "IsAllowedToCast"
  "QueryCastCost" etc.
  Writing a spell will therefore in the most simple case only
  require to write the above mentione function, all syntax and
  allowance handling performed by teh server
- Spells will (usually) be related to one (more?) skills, stating
  the knowledge of the player in that magic area (compare druids
  in NF, fire, water skills). That skill can also be a simple
  "magic knowledge". Success of casting askill will be determined
  be checking the skill values, the proficientcy of the player in
  the particular spell (0..1000) and maybe a little WISDOM as
  a general knowledge ability about magic.
- WISdom will be used to determine the learing rate of the spells
  as well as the ability whether a spell can be used at all
- Spellpoints depend on WISdom and INTelligence
- Making a spell available to players require a scroll or guildobject
  to simply add an add_action on the "cast" /"Invoke"/"Pray" or
  whatever command and relay that call to the spellserver which
  handles the rest.
