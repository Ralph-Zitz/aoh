DESCRIPTION
    Here a brief definition of some terms concerning magic resistance:

	Resistance: 
	    Means the chance that a magic attack will have NO EFFECT at all
	    on a living. Resistances can be specified against all damage
	    types or even scrolls. The range of resistance values is 0-100. 
		A resisted attack can result in a repulsion of that attack back
		on the attacker.

	    Although somewhat inconsistently names, the P_MAGIC_DEFENCE is
	    an attribute to give a living resistance against ALL magic damage
	    types.


   Defence:
       A (conventional or magic) defence against a certain damage type
	   reduces the AMOUNT of damage done to the attacked living. The
	   range of values for a defence is free in principle. A defence
	   can never result in a repulsion of an attack as it simply 
	   absorps the damage.


   Repulsion:
       If a living is resistant against a certain type of attack there
	   might be a chance that an attack which had been performed against
	   that living and which had been resisted will be fired back on
	   the attacker. The amount of damage done should be less or equal
	   to the damage which the first attack would have done and of the
	   same type.
