archmages are special, they can choose a second school to that one they
already are in when they change to archmages. This second school CANNOT
be of an opposite school to their old one, but the spells of it will be
handled as basic spells for the archmage now too.

It looks kind of unbalanced but the spells are different in power AND
some schools do have more spells of their own than others.
As long the school is not opposite one may learn the spells from other
schools, but has to reach a higher level to learn them and will NEVER
become expert in casting the spell.
