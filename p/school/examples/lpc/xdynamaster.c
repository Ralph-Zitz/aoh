/*   Master room for dynamic maze example (Mateese 29-Sep-1992)
**
** This object is not used as a room (though this could be possible),
** but merely serves as a database for the maze rooms.
** The maze is very simple: the only variant data are the exits of the
** several rooms.
**
** Note that there are several ways to realize a dynamic room areal,
** this is just one (of the easiest, though efficient).
** Just the GD assisted variant (see /d/archwiz/common/lpc/exm/xmaze0)
** is even easier and in any case to be preferred.
**
** -- About dynamic rooms --
**   Dynamic rooms are a simple but effective way to reduce the amount of
** diskspace used to implement a certain uniform area, like a maze.
**   A typical maze consists of many rooms which have only few differences
** in description and content. Implementing the maze in a one-file-per-
** room-system is straightforward, simple and ineffective then.
** Its better to concentrate the variant data in one maze-master, which
** then creates the rooms from one basic file on demand. This basic file
** contains the fixed data (and some utility funs), and gets the variant
** data from the maze master upon creation.
**   This way one has just a few room _files_, but is able to create a maze
** consisting of many room _objects_.
**   Moving the player through the maze takes a certain care, though.
** Since the room objects don't know about their neighboured rooms, the
** move-command of one player needs to be executed by the maze master.
**   The maze master itself may be used as a normal room, but needn't.
** Important is, that the master is just loaded, never cloned.
**
** If you`re interested in a big 'real' dynamic maze, take a look at
** Chalamah's quest.
