The climb skill handling of OSB

  How to add a climbing skill to a room:
  --------------------------------------

  Climb the pole, which does exactely the same as the tree but you
  do not need extra functions as the default implementation in the
  skillserver willhandle the standard climb

    AddSkill(SK_CLIMB,"pole",100,({"pole","huge pole"}),
     ([P_SK_CLIMB_MSG:({"climbs the pole","climbs in","climb the pole"}),
       P_SK_CLIMB_DEST:"./climb2_room",
       P_SK_CLIMB_HURTHP:5]) );


  Climb the tree with 10% difficulty..you need to define own climbing
  functions OnSucceedClimbingXXX and OnFailClimbingXXX
  as shown in /p/school/examples/skills/climb_room.c
  
    AddSkill(SK_CLIMB,"tree",100,({"tree","huge tree"}));


  Functions of the climbing skill:
  --------------------------------
  mixed OnSucceedClimbing(object who, int skill, string arg, string extra,mixed p)

  This function will be called when a climbing attemt succeeds.

  Parameter: who:  The living which performed the skill
             skill: How well did the living pass the check (1..1000)
             p: A Mapping containing following properties

             P_SK_CLIMB_MSG: is the argument give to a M_SPECIAL. 
               If ommitted a standard M_GO is used
             P_SK_CLIMB_DEST: is the destination room, where the 
               player will arrive
             P_SK_CLIMB_HURTHP: is the amount of HP the player will 
               loose on failing the climb and falling to the ground. 
               It can be a closure returning the amount of damage

             arg: What is meant for climbing (e.g. tree)
             extra: What text is given after the "arg" (if any)
  

  mixed OnFailClimbing(object who, int skill, string arg, string extra,mixed p)
  The function is called when a climbing attempt fails. Its
  arguments are exactly like the one for OnSucceedClimbing.


  string CannotClimbing(object who,nt diff, string arg,string extra,mixed p)

  This function will return a string when "who" is not able
  to climb at all. The string is then notify_failed to the player.
  The arguments are again as above.
