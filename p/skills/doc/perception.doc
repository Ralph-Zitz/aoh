The perception skill handling of OSB

  How to add a secret for the perceptiong skill to a room:
  --------------------------------------------------------

  Adds a secret 'trap door' to this room. Its difficulty to find is
  750 (1/10 precent=hard) and the text the player sees when detecting
  the secret is contained in the array. The first string is given
  when the skill check gives a low result the third string resp.
  is shown when the skill checks results a high result. So you can
  show an experienced player more information
  
    AddSecret("trap door",750,
      ({"The floor below one of the chairs looks a bit strange.\n",
        "You detect a trap door below one of the chairs.\n",
        "Below one of the chairs you detect a trapdoor to a treasure chamber.\n"
      }) );

  If one string is enough we could as well write
    AddSecret("trap door",750,"One of the chairs looks a bit strange.\n");

  Adds a secret 'hidden letter' to this room. Its difficulty to find
  is 250 (1/10 percetn=medium easy) and the text the players sees when
  finding the secret is provided by the Function "Find Letter"
    AddSecret("hidden letter",250,#'FindLetter);

  We now need the function "FindLetter":
  varargs string FindLetter(string secret,object who,int skillvalue)
  The arguments of this function are 'who':the player to which the
  text will be shown and 'secret':The name of the secet as given
  as first argument to the AddSecret command and 'skillvalue':
  the 1/10 precent value how well the player passed the skill test
  1:very poor and 1000:superb..you might want to return different
  strings depending on this value



  Internal functions:

                a stringarray (which string is shown, depends on

                string show_secret(string secret, int skill,object who)
             difficulty: How difficult (0..1000) is it to find the
