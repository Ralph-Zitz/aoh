The searching skill handling of OSB

  Search for some herbs which are predefined in herbs.h.
  No special functions have to be written as it uses the standard
  handling
    AddSkill(SK_SEARCH,"herbs",750,({"herb","herbs"}),
             ([WOODHERBS(1000,1000)]));

  Add our own searching skill. 
    AddSkill(SK_SEARCH,"bushes",250,({"bush","bushes"}));
  We need to supply the functions:
    int OnSucceedSearchingBushes(see below)
    int OnFailSearchingBushes(see below)
  and optinal:
  string CannotSearchingHole(...)
  

  
  

  Functions of the searching skill:
  --------------------------------
 
  mixed OnSucceedSearching(object who, int skill, string arg, mixed extra,mixed p)

  This function will be called when a searching attemt succeeds.
