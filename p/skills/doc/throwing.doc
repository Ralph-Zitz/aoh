The throwing skill handling of OSB

  How to add a throwing skill to a room:
  --------------------------------------

  Add the possibilty to throw this ball. How difficult it is to
  throw the ball is determined by the 250 (1:extremely easy, 1000:
  extermly hard). The array with 'ball' etc are the keywords which
  you can throw [might later on be combined with the Ids/Ads
  The last argument, the big mapping, is fully optional, i.e. you
  can omit it. Here you can specify some additional properties for
  the skills as shown above. You can use 0,1 or all of them
  
    AddSkill(SK_THROW,0,250,({"ball","small ball","crystal ball"}));

  or more advanced:

    AddSkill(SK_THROW,0,250,({"ball","small ball","crystal ball"}),
         ([
           P_SK_THROW_MSG:#'throw_msg, 
                // we want an individual message when
                // the ball is thrown. They are provided
                // by this function
           P_SK_THROW_DISTANCE:50, 
                // we can throw at most 50m
                // use -1 for infinite distances
                // use 0(default) this room only
	     P_SK_THROW_HITHP:5,     
                // 5 HP damage when hitting an enemy
                // This can also be a function returning
                // object to)
             P_SK_THROW_BREAK_CHANCE:500,
                // 50% chance to break on fail
             P_SK_THROW_BREAK_FUN:#'throw_break,
                // the crystal ball is breaked
                // in this function
         ]) );


  Functions of the throwing skill:
  --------------------------------
  mixed OnSucceedThrowing(object who, int skill, string arg, string extra,mixed p)

  This function will be called when a throwing attemt succeeds.

  Parameter: who:  The living which performed the skill
             skill: How well did the living pass the check (1..1000)
             p: A Mapping containing following properties

             P_SK_THROW_MSG: A closure which produces output when the
               thing is thrown
                 void throw_msg(object from,object to,string id, int modus)
                 [modus=0: to room,1:throw to friend, 2:throw at enemy]
	     P_SK_THROW_DISTANCE: How many meters can the object be
               thrown (-1: infinitely, 0: only in this room)
	     P_SK_THROW_HITHP: How many HP dmage when hitting an enemy
               This can also be a closure calculating the damage
               int throw_dam(string id,object from,object to)
             P_SK_THROW_BREAK_CHANCE: Chance (0..1000) to break on fail
             P_SK_THROW_BREAK_FUN: Closure which will be called when
               object is breaking
               void throw_break(string id, object from)

             arg: What is meant for throwing (e.g. ball)
             extra: What text is given after the "arg" (if any)
  

  mixed OnFailThrowing(object who, int skill, string arg, string extra,mixed p)
  The function is called when a thorwing attempt fails. Its
  arguments are exactly like the one for OnSucceedThrowing.


  string CannotThrowing(object who,int diff, string id,string extra,mixed p)

  This function will return a string when "who" is not able
  to throw at all. The string is then notify_failed to the player.
  The arguments are again as above.
