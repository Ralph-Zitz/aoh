  Choose life.
  Choose a job.
  Choose a career.
  Choose a family.
  Choose a fucking big television.
  Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical 
    tin openers...
  Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.
  Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit crushing 
    game shows, stuffing junk food into your mouth.  
  Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a 
    miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, 
    fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourself.
  Choose a future.
  Choose life...
  But why would I want to do a thing like that?
