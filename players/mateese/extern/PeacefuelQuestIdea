Well, if you're trying to avoid a hack-n-slash mud, the basic question
to ask is this:  why do players want to kill things so much?  Well, the
way I see it there are two basic reasons:

1.  A lot of muds give out experience either solely or primarily for
    killing monsters.

2.  By killing monsters, players get money and treasure.

3.  A lot of muds don't have many other things to do.

4.  Most muds don't have any monsters that you're punished for killing.

Now, people tend to do the things they're rewarded for, and not do
what they're punished for.  If they often get rewarded for killing
monsters, and never get punished for it, they're gonna kill monsters
every chance they get.

What can you do about this?  Break the things given above.  Give out
experience for things other than killing monsters; if you really want
to decrease killing monsters, give out little or no experience for
killing them.  Make sure that there are other things for players to
do besides kill monsters.  Have places where people are punished for
killing monsters, or monsters that people are punished for killing.

Some examples:

In an area I built, I didn't want players to be killing things.  
However, I don't like arbitrary limits like "no combat" areas, so
I took another tack.  If you attack anything in that area, the 
police arrive a short time later and haul you off to jail.  Your
character is stuck in the jail for a few minutes, then released.
It didn't take long for people to quit attacking things there.  :-)

A friend of mine once proposed a "peaceful quest."  You enter
an area where there are all sorts of strange and horrible monsters;
in the center of the area is a tower.  An evil magician lives in the
tower, and to complete the quest, you have to defeat him... at least,
so you're told.  :-)  In truth, you can't defeat him.  If you fight
him, he'll win and lock you up in a cage.  *If* you've been nice to
the monsters in the area, all the monsters there will finally revolt
against the evil wizard when he locks you up; they kill him and free
you, and you complete the quest.  Of course, there are clues for
the player; things like a monster with a thorn in his paw, monsters
locked up in the wizards' tower being tortured that you can free, and
who will tell you (if you free them) that the "monsters" are all
really people who the wizard has experimented on, etc.  He's never
gotten to implement it anywhere yet, but I think it's a wonderful
idea for making hack-n-slashers reconsider their ways.  :-)

Lastly, a mud I'm helping with the mudlib on right now is being 
designed to not have experience points; instead, you go up in
skills by using them.  Thus, combat makes you better at combat,
but not at anything else.  This should encourage people to do
a wider variety of things.  :-)
