The nannymud soul, A marvel of modern LPC programming
*****************************************************

Examples
========

First, lets start with the most simple feeling possible: 

> hmm
You hmm.
>

This was simple, wasn't it?

Now, lets add some adverbs: 

> hmm swe sof
You hmm sweetly and softly.
>

Also quite simple, but note that the soul does a regexp matching on adverbs, it is enough to type the shortest possible unique
prefix. 

Now the next example: 

> hmm sw
What adverb was that?
sweetly  swiftly
>

Now we can note Yet Another Feature(tm), if you type an to short prefix (sw in this case) the soul will type out all the
matching adverbs. 

Ok, now we will add some more complexity: 

> hmm mil slo and poke him
You hmm slowly at Milamber and poke him in the ribs.
> 

Ok, so now we hmm at a person, and poke him in the ribs as well. (Note the usa of him in this example, there are also the
magical words them, her and it. The usage should be obvious. (They all refer to the last person(s) used). Also note that the
soul does matching on names as well.) 

Ok, now we are ready for something fairly complex: 

> dont yawn very hear and poke mmm eye almost soft
You try not to yawn very heartbrokenly and poke Mmmmmmmm almost softly in
 the eye, but fail miserably.
> fail yawn very hear and poke mmm eye almost soft
You try to yawn very heartbrokenly and poke Mmmmmmmm almost softly in 
the eye, but fail miserably.
> again yawn very hear and poke mmm eye almost soft
You yawn very heartbrokenly and poke Mmmmmmmm almost softly in 
the eye again.

Note the quite small, but very important differance between fail and dont. Also note that you can put grades on your
adverbs: very, extremely, somewhat and almost.
