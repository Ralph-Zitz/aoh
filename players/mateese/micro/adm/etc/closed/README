If the games needs to be closed, place a file with the "Sorry, game is
closed" text in here. It then gets printed on login.
The mere fact of placing a file here leads to the rejection of login
attempts!
To vary the level of closedness, name the file approbiately:
  'LEARNER' to reject all players
  'WIZARD'  to reject all players and learners.
  'ARCH'    to additionally reject all non-Arches.
  'ADMIN'   to allow just gods and admins.
