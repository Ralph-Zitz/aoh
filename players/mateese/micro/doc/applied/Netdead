  the result. If a change is detected, the players environment and
  inventory is informed.
  The function is at least called by /secure/login if an existing player
  object is reactivated.
    check: if non-zero, perform the check after a few seconds (this is
           used by the master upon loss of the connection).
  Result:
    0: if the player is netdead, !0 else.

IMPLEMENTED

  Called by /secure/login, /secure/master, and other objects.
