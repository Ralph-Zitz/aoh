SYNOPSIS
  mixed P_Autodata

DESCRIPTION
  If an object is to be autoloading, this property has to return a
  non-zero value. This value will be set as P_Autodata on recreation to
  let the object re-initialize itself.
  Implementation is by using filterfunctions (Set- and QueryAutodata()).
  Default is to return/set P_Props.
