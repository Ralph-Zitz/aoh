SYNOPSIS
  int P_Cleanup (int ref)

DESCRIPTION
  This property influences the handling of the object on cleanup:
    ref: the ref-parameter passed to clean_up()
      < 0: the environment calls the object to clean up.
      = 0: object is a clone, or a blueprint with replaced program.
      = 1: object is swapped and/or unreferenced blueprint.
      > 1: object has <ref> references.
  Result:
    <= 0: object may selfdestruct if it has no environment (default).
     = 1: object shall never clean up.
     > 1: object might clean up later.
