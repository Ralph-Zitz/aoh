SYNOPSIS
  mixed P_NoAutoload

DESCRIPTION
  Setting this property to a non-zero value makes the holding object
  non-autoloading, by forcing P_Autodata to return 0.
  Note that this property can just inhibit the autoloading of an object,
  not vice versa. Nor is it an indicator for the autoloading behaviour
  of an object.
