  /secure/simul_efun

  /secure/efun.h

DESCRIPTION
  Simulated efuns are efuns implemented in the mudlib, but available
  without additional fuss, like real efuns are.

  The simul efuns are implemented as macros in /secure/efun.h, and
  as real functions in /secure/simul_efun.c.
  /secure/simul_efun_spare.c is a backup object in case the real
  simul_efun.c is nonfunctional.

  The simulated efuns themselves are documented in /doc/sefun.
