SYNOPSIS
  void call_out(string fun, int delay, mixed arg, ...)
  void call_out(closure cl, int delay, mixed arg, ...)

DESCRIPTION
  Set up a call to function fun or closure cl in the current
  object. The call will take place in delay seconds, with the
  remaining argument list provided. delay can be a minimum time
  of one second.

  call_out() saves and restores the current user. It is now
  possible to use say() or write() which rely on a current
  user to be something useful.

  If there are more than 1000 call_outs pending, a warning is
  issued, and after the 1200th pending call_out, further call_outs
  are rejected, until the number falls below 300 again.

  Appropriate logs are made in /log/adm/callout.

BUGS
  Due to the way the driver works, only 15 arguments are available
  to the function called per call_out().
