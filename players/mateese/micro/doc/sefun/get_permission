SYNOPSIS
  nomask string get_permission (object obj, void | string domain)

DESCRIPTION
  Get the permission of an object <obj> (BOTTOMID if <obj> is 0).
  If <domain> is specified, the permission is computed in relation
  to the specified domain.

  Result is the permission string.
  Normally this is the euid of the object (BOTTOMID if obj is 0).
  However, if the object is 'unguarded', the object's uid is used
  as permission.
  Alternatively, if the object is or was interactive, the permission
  as returned by SECUREINFO->Permission() is returned.
