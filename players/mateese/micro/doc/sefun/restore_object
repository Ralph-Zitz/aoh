SYNOPSIS
  int restore_object(string name)

DESCRIPTION
  Restore values of variables for current object from file name.
  If name ends in ``.c'', this suffix is stripped of by the parser.
  The master object will probably append a .o to the name.

  Since microMud has a more complicate way of storing variables,
  this simul_efun just calls restore(<name>) in the same object().

  Variables that has the type modifer 'static' will not be saved.

SEE ALSO
  save_object(efun), valid_read(master)
