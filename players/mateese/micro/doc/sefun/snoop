SYNOPSIS
  object snoop(object snooper)
  object snoop(object snooper, object snoopee)

DESCRIPTION
  Starts a snoop from 'snooper' on 'snoopee', or if 'snoopee' is not
  given, terminates any snoop from 'snooper'.
  On success, 'snoopee' is returned, else 0.

  The snoop is checked with the master object for validity.
  It will also fail if the 'snoopee' is being snooped already or
  if a snoop would result in a recursive snoop action.

  Snoops on someone of same or higher level are notified to the snoopee.
  Snoops by learners are not anonymous, what means that they are visible
  to every wizard, always notified to the victim, and may be terminated
  by every wizard.

  Snoops by non-archwizards are logged in /log/adm/snoop.
