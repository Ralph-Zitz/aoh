microMud is a small spare time project to supply the mud world (well,
the Amylaar part of it) with a mudlib small enough to be included into
the driver. Ideally it will become a starter mudlib for 3.2 like the old
2.4.5-mudlib was.
Therefore  microMud does not have tons of nifty features (though I
implemented some of my pet ideas :-), but I hope I managed to keep it
flexible and powerful.
