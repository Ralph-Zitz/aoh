Various objects and files ready for general use.
In contrast to /b and /std, this directory is accessible to Arches
as well.
Idea is that every object in the mud inherits its general features
by one of the /g-objects, having it's own code to add just its
special abilities. This way, consistence throughout the whole mud
can be achieved more easily.
