/* Death-Mark
**
** The main purpose of the mark is to be autoloading to prevent cheating.
** Thus we don't make it a fullfledged 'thing'.
** But since we have it, it can also do some nicies.
**
**   26-Aug-92 [m] Adapted for native.
**   16-Apr-97 [t] Small update to give different messages depending on
**                 the kills of a player.
