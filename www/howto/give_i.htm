<h1>How to code a give 'command'</h1>

There are (mainly) two possible applications where we
need a 'give' command:
<ul>
<li>A npc (or any other living but not a player) should check, that
    an item is given to him.
<li>The given item should detect itself, that it is given away.
</ul>

Both applications are often used while coding quests. There are some
ways on 'how to code' these commands.

<p>

Some notes for new wizards:<br>
The first try - coding it with an<p>
<code>
init() {<br>
&nbsp; ::init();<br>
&nbsp; add_action("cmd_give","give");<br>
}<p>
</code>
is the worst way for both mentioned applications to do this!
(but it possible to use an own action with some additional tricks 
and checks of course).<br>
I will show some better code parts on how to code it. The last example 
will show you how you can code your own action (like shown above), 
but if you check the code you will see, that it is much more complicated 
than the other versions, show in the examples.

<p>

If you follow these hints all players will be able to (for example):<p>
<i>'give second red flower from small dirty bag 4 of sweet panda to 
old dwarf 3'</i><p>
Which means: give the second flower (that reacts to adjective red) from
the 4th bag (that reacts to adjectives small and dirty, and which is placed
inside the panda (which reacts to adjective sweet) to the 3rd dwarf in a room,
which reacts to the adjective old.<br>
Cool - eh?<br>

<p>

Okay lets start with the examples:<br>
We will start with some examples for an npc, which should 
reacts to different given items:
<ul>
<li><a href="give1.htm">Simple give</a>
<li><a href="give2.htm">Extended give</a>
<li><a href="give3.htm">Accept only special items</a>
</ul>

Now some examples for items, which should detect their own moving:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="move1.htm">Detect a move</a>
<li><a href="move2.htm">Moving control</a>
</ul>
