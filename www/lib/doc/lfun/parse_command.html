/*****************************************************
<P>
  This is the parser used by the efun parse_command
<P>
*/
/*
<P>
  General documentation
<P>
  parse_command() is one of the most complex efun in LPmud to use. It takes
  some effort to learn and use, but when mastered, very powerfull constructs
  can be implemented.
<P>
  Basically parse_command() is a piffed up sscanf operating on word basis. It
  works similar to sscanf in that it takes a pattern and a variable set of
  destination arguments. It is together with sscanf the only efun to use
  pass by reference for other variables than arrays.
<P>
  To make the efun usefull it must have a certain support from the mudlib,
  there is a set of functions that it needs to call to get relevant
  information before it can parse in a sensible manner.
<P>
  In earlier versions it used the normal id() lfun in the LPC objects to
  find out if a given object was identified by a certain string. This was
  highly inefficient as it could result in hundreds or maybe thousands of
  calls when very long commands were parsed. 
  
  The new version relies on the LPC objects to give it three lists of 'names'.
<P>
<OL>
       <LI> - The normal singular names.
       <LI> - The plural forms of the names.
       <LI> - The acknowledged adjectives of the object.
</OL>
<P>
  These are fetched by calls to the functions
<P>
<OL>
       <LI> - string *parse_command_id_list();
       <LI> - string *parse_command_plural_id_list();
       <LI> - string *parse_command_adjectiv_id_list();
</OL>
<P>
  The only really needed list is the first. If the second does not exist
  than the efun will try to create one from the singluar list. For 
  grammatical reasons it does not always succeed in a perfect way. This is
  especially true when the 'names' are not single words but phrases.
<P>
  The third is very nice to have because it makes constructs like
  'get all the little blue ones' possible.
<P>
  Apart from these functions that should exist in all objects, and which
  are therefore best put in /std/object.c there is also a set of functions
  needed in /secure/master.c These are not absolutely necessary but they
  give extra power to the efun.
<P>
  Basically these /secure/master.c lfuns are there to give default values
  for the lists of names fetched from each object.
<P>
  The names in these lists are applicable to any and all objects, the first
  three are identical to the lfun's in the objects
<PRE>
       string *parse_command_id_list()
		- Would normally return: ({ &quot;one&quot;, &quot;thing&quot; })

       string *parse_command_plural_id_list()
		- Would normally return: ({ &quot;ones&quot;, &quot;things&quot;, &quot;them&quot; })

       string *parse_command_adjectiv_id_list()
		- Would normally return ({ &quot;iffish&quot; })
</PRE>
  The last two are the default list of the prepositions and a single so called
  'all' word. 
<PRE>
       string *parse_command_prepos_list()
		 - Would normally return: ({ &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;under&quot; })

       string parse_command_all_word()
		 - Would normally return: &quot;all&quot;
</PRE>
  IF you want to use a different language than English but still want the
  default pluralform maker to work, you need to replace parse.c with the
  following file
<PRE>
#if 0
    * Language configured parse.c
    *
    #define PARSE_FOREIGN
   
    char *parse_to_plural(str)
	char *str;
    {
<P>
	* Your own plural converter for your language *
     
    }
<P>
      * The numberwords below should be replaced for the new language *
<P>
    static char *ord1[] = {&quot;&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, &quot;fourth&quot;, &quot;fifth&quot;,
			   &quot;sixth&quot;, &quot;seventh&quot;, &quot;eighth&quot;, &quot;nineth&quot;, &quot;tenth&quot;,
			   &quot;eleventh&quot;, &quot;twelfth&quot;, &quot;thirteenth&quot;, &quot;fourteenth&quot;,
			   &quot;fifteenth&quot;, &quot;sixteenth&quot;, &quot;seventeenth&quot;, 
			   &quot;eighteenth&quot;,&quot;nineteenth&quot;};
<P>
    static char *ord10[] = {&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;twenty&quot;,&quot;thirty&quot;,&quot;forty&quot;,&quot;fifty&quot;,&quot;sixty&quot;,
			    &quot;seventy&quot;, &quot;eighty&quot;,&quot;ninety&quot;};
    
    static char *sord10[] = {&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;twentieth&quot;, &quot;thirtieth&quot;, &quot;fortieth&quot;,
			     &quot;fiftieth&quot;, &quot;sixtieth&quot;,&quot;seventieth&quot;, &quot;eightieth&quot;,
			     &quot;ninetieth&quot;};
<P>
    static char *num1[] = {&quot;&quot;, &quot;one&quot;,&quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;,&quot;four&quot;,&quot;five&quot;,&quot;six&quot;,
			   &quot;seven&quot;,&quot;eight&quot;,&quot;nine&quot;,&quot;ten&quot;,
			   &quot;eleven&quot;,&quot;twelve&quot;,&quot;thirteen&quot;,&quot;fourteen&quot;,&quot;fifteen&quot;,

<P>
#endif
  
  When all these things are defined parse_command() works best and most
  efficient. What follows is the docs for how to use it from LPC
<P>
<P>
  Doc for LPC function
<P>
int parse_command(string, object/object*, string, destargs...)
<P>
			Returns 1 if pattern matches
<P>
	string		Given command
<P>
	object*		if arr 
	object			array holding the accessible objects
			if ob
				object from which to recurse and create
				the list of accessible objects, normally
				ob = environment(this_player())
	string		Parsepattern as list of words and formats
			Example string = &quot; 'get' / 'take' %i &quot;
			Syntax
				'word'		obligatory text
				[word]		optional text
				/		Alternative marker
				%o		Single item, object
				%l		Living objects
				%s		Any text
				%w		Any word
				%p		One of a list (prepositions)
				%i		Any items
				%d		Number 0- or tx(0-99)
<P>
	destargs	This is the list of result variables as in sscanf
			One variable is needed for each %_
			The return types of different %_ is
			%o	Returns an object
			%s	Returns a string of words
			%w	Returns a string of one word
			%p	Can on entry hold a list of word in array
				or an empty variable
				Returns
				   if empty variable: a string
				   if array: array[0]=matched word
			%i	Returns a special array on the form
				[0] = (int) +(wanted) -(order) 0(all)
				[1..n] (object) Objectpointers	
			%l	Returns a special array on the form
				[0] = (int) +(wanted) -(order) 0(all)
				[1..n] (object) Objectpointers
						These are only living objects.
			%d	Returns a number
</PRE>
  The only types of % that uses all the loaded information from the objects
  are %i and %l. These are in fact identical except that %l filters out
  all nonliving objects from the list of objects before trying to parse.
<P>
  The return values of %i and %l is also the most complex. They return an
  array consisting of first a number and then all possible objects matching.
  As the typical string matched by %i/%l looks like: 'three red roses',
  'all nasty bugs' or 'second blue sword' the number indicates which 
  of these numerical constructs was matched
<PRE>
	 if numeral &gt;0 then three, four, five etc were matched
	 if numeral &lt;0 then second, twentyfirst etc were matched
	 if numeral==0 then 'all' or a generic plural form such as 'apples'
			    were matched.
</PRE>
  NOTE!
       The efun makes no semantic implication on the given numeral. It does
       not matter if 'all apples' or 'second apple' is given. A %i will
       return ALL possible objects matching in the array. It is up to the
       caller to decide what 'second' means in a given context.
<P>
       Also when given an object and not an explicit array of objects the
       entire recursive inventory of the given object is searched. It is up
       to the caller to decide which of the objects are actually visible
       meaning that 'second' might not at all mean the second object in
       the returned array of objects.
			
<DT><H3>EXAMPLE</H3>
<DD>
<PRE>
 if (parse_command(&quot;spray car&quot;,environment(this_player()),
		      &quot; 'spray' / 'paint' [paint] %i &quot;,items))	
 {
      If the pattern matched then items holds a return array as described
	under 'destargs' %i above.
     
 }
</PRE>
<DT><H3>BUGS</H3>
<DD>
 / Features
<P>
 Patterns of type: &quot;%s %w %i&quot;<BR>
   Might not work as one would expect. %w will always succeed so the arg
   corresponding to %s will always be empty.
<P>
 Patterns of the type: 'word' and [word]<BR>
   The 'word' can not contain spaces. It must be a single word. This is so
   because the pattern is exploded on &quot; &quot; (space) and a pattern element can
   therefore not contain spaces.
	    This will be fixed in the future
