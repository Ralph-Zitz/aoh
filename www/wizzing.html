At the moment we aren't really considering applications for new wizards.
Our first priority is to make decisions concerning guilds, combat, skills,
races, and stats. We invite anyone who is interested in being a wiz to
kick back for now, hang out, chat, and give us your 2 cents about what
makes an lpmud really great. When we have that accomplished, ask us
again about wizzing. Thanks!
